    " Persuasion Strategies:\n",
    "Credibility Appeal\n",
    "Definition: Emphasize the insurance provider’s reputation, trustworthiness, or long-standing service.\n",
    "Use when: The user is hesitant, asks about reliability, or mentions concern over service quality.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"New India Assurance has one of the widest repair networks in India and a proven record of settling claims efficiently.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical Appeal\n",
    "Definition: Use facts, comparisons, benefits, or pricing logic to persuade.\n",
    "Use when: The user is analytical, budget-conscious, or asking for details or comparisons.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"HDFC ERGO’s policy includes 24/7 support and zero-depreciation coverage, which means more savings during repairs.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Persona-Based Appeal\n",
    "Definition: Match the policy features to the user’s lifestyle, habits, or profile.\n",
    "Use when: The user reveals driving habits, tech-savviness, family needs, or risk aversion.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"Since you often drive long distances, Tata AIG’s Telematics-Based Monitoring suits your tech-savvy lifestyle.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Emotional Appeal\n",
    "Definition: Tap into feelings like fear, safety, or care for loved ones.\n",
    "Use when: The user talks about family, emergencies, peace of mind, or personal safety.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"Imagine a late-night breakdown—our 24/7 roadside assistance gives you and your family peace of mind.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Personal Appeal\n",
    "Definition: Use positive sentiment, social proof, or popularity of the plan.\n",
    "Use when: The user is unsure or looking for recommendations.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"This plan is one of our most popular choices—users love the smooth claims experience.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Default Persuasion Strategy\n",
    "Definition: Use when little context is available. Provide neutral, factual reassurance.\n",
    "Use when: The user is vague or hasn’t revealed any preferences or concerns.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"This policy offers protection against theft, accidents, and includes access to cashless repairs.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
