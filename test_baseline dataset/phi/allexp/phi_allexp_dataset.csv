### Follow-up Question 1:

How could the sentiment analysis model account for sarcasm or coded language that might not be overtly positive or negative?

### Answer to Follow-up Question 1:

The model would need to be trained on datasets containing sarcastic or coded language examples to recognize patterns that are not straightforward. It would also benefit from understanding context, cultural references, and linguistic cues that often accompany sarcasm or coded language. Advanced techniques such as deep learning and natural language processing with attention to subtleties in word usage and sentence construction can help decode the true intent behind such text.

### Follow-up Question 2:

Would the sentiment analysis model be able to differentiate between a genuinely positive review and one that uses positive language to subtly criticize?

### Answer to Follow-up Question 2:

Yes, but this is a complex task. The model would have to analyze the context, linguistic cues, and contrasts in the text. It would need to detect nuances, such as when positive language is used in a context or alongside cues that indicate criticism, which requires a deep understanding of language and context beyond the words themselves. It may require cross-referencing with known patterns of criticism and a sophisticated understanding of the subject matter."
