For a student like you, every rupee counts, and this policy will help you save on your insurance costs without compromising on coverage. Let's proceed with finding the best policy for your Royal Enfield Classic 350.","For a student, ""far more"" typically refers to the difference in coverage levels.

A **comprehensive policy** ( ₹30,000–₹50,000/year) adds coverage for your own bike’s repairs, theft, fire, and natural disasters. 

As a student, if budget is tight, third-party might suffice, but a comprehensive policy offers peace of mind for a classic bike like yours. Some insurers also offer student discounts or no-claim bonuses to lower long-term costs. Let me know your priority: minimal cost or broader protection?"

Let's review the details of each policy and find the one that best suits your needs and budget. Shall we proceed?","For theft coverage on your Royal Enfield 350, **Bajaj Allianz**, **ICICI Lombard**, and **TATA AIG** are reliable, budget-friendly options. Premiums for comprehensive plans (including theft) typically range from **₹3,500 to ₹6,000 annually**, depending on add-ons. Basic third-party coverage (mandatory) is around **₹1,500–₹2,000**.

So, for $1100, what additional perks do I get that make it worth it over the absolute cheapest option?"," The digital discount policy offers comprehensive coverage for your Royal Enfield Classic 350, including theft, accidental damage, and third-party liability. For an additional investment of $1100, you'll also enjoy benefits like 24/7 claims support, no-claim bonus protection, and roadside assistance. These added perks make the digital discount policy a worthwhile investment, providing you with peace of mind and enhanced protection for your bike. Shall we proceed with reviewing the details of this policy?","The $1100 comprehensive policy (with digital discount) includes theft coverage, personal accident protection, medical expenses for injuries, and roadside assistance—perks not in the cheapest third-party-only option.
