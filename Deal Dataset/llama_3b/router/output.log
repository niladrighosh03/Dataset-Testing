User: I want to relax, please add Healing Therapies.
Agent: Okay, thanks, sir. After adding the Healing Therapies, the package cost is $16,000.

User: Hello, I'm interested in buying the Adventure Trekking Expedition package. Can you provide me with details about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello, the Adventure Trekking Expedition package offers accommodation, transportation, meals, guided treks, camping equipment rental, local guides, hot springs relaxation, cultural village visit, and adventure activities. The package is priced at $17600. It's a great opportunity to experience thrilling adventures and immerse yourself in the beauty of nature.
User: What type of accommodations are included in the Adventure Trekking Expedition package?
Agent: The Adventure Trekking Expedition package includes accommodations.
User: I would like to remove the Adventure activities from the package as I am not interested in participating in them.
Agent: I understand that you want to remove the Adventure activities from the package. As an alternative, I would recommend opting for just the Camping equipment rental, which will lower the price of the tour to $17600. This way, you can still enjoy the accommodation, transportation, meals, and guided treks within your budget.
User: I would like to have local guides included in the package as I would like to have a knowledgeable person show me around the area.
Agent: Absolutely, including local guides in your package is a great idea. The total cost of the tour with this amenity is $19045.
User: I understand the value of including local guides in the package, but my budget is fixed at $14330. Is there any way we can work within that budget?
Agent: I understand that your budget is fixed at $14330, but considering the value of including local guides, I can offer you this package at $16954.16832224629. Let me know if that works for you.
User: I appreciate your understanding, but I'm afraid I cannot go beyond my budget of $14330. Is there any possibility of adjusting the package to fit within my price range?
Agent: I understand your budget concerns, but I'm afraid we cannot go below our proposal of $16449.26. However, I can assure you that this package offers excellent value for money and includes several extra perks.
Current Utterance: User: I appreciate your understanding of my budget concerns. However, I really cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $14330. Is there any possibility for a further reduction or any other way to accommodate my budget?

User: Hi there, I am interested in purchasing the Adventure Trekking Expedition package. Could you please provide me with information about the package as well as the price?
Agent: Hello, the Adventure Trekking Expedition package offers accommodation, transportation, meals, guided treks, camping equipment rental, local guides, hot springs relaxation, cultural village visits, and adventure activities. All of this is included in the package price of $17600.
User: What type of accommodation is provided in the Adventure Trekking Expedition package?
Agent: The Adventure Trekking Expedition package provides accommodation options such as camping or staying in local lodges or guesthouses.
User: What meals are included in the Adventure Trekking Expedition package?
Agent: The Adventure Trekking Expedition package includes meals for the duration of the trip.
User: I would like to have local guides included in the package as I want to have a deeper understanding and knowledge of the places we will be visiting.
Agent: Absolutely, adding the amenity of Local guides will greatly enhance your experience and knowledge of the places you'll be visiting. The final tour cost, including Local guides, is $19100.
User: I appreciate the offer, but $19100 is still above my budget. I can only go up to $12136.588150651289. Is there any way we can work around this?
Agent: I understand your concern about the budget. While I cannot go down to $12136.588150651289, I can offer you a discounted rate of $16954.16832224629. This is the best I can do considering your budget limitations.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for understanding my budget limitations. However, $16954.16832224629 is still higher than what I can afford. My budget for the tour package is $12472.439065487026. Can we work with that price?

Agent: I understand your budget limitations and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm afraid that the package price of $16954.16832224629 is the best we can offer considering the services and amenities included. If you can increase your budget slightly to $14000, I can try to make some adjustments to accommodate your needs.
Current Utterance: User: I think I would prefer to explore the destination on my own, so I would like to remove the amenity of Local guides from the package.

User: Thank you for understanding my budget limitations. However, $16954.16832224629 is still higher than what I can afford. My budget for the tour package is $12472.439065487026. Can we work with that price?
Agent: I understand your budget limitations and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm afraid that the package price of $16954.16832224629 is the best we can offer considering the services and amenities included. If you can increase your budget slightly to $14000, I can try to make some adjustments to accommodate your needs.
User: I think I would prefer to explore the destination on my own, so I would like to remove the amenity of Local guides from the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to explore the destination on your own and remove the amenity of Local guides from the package. As an alternative, we can offer Adventure activities which will lower down the price of the tour to $16954.16832224629.
Current Utterance: User: I apologize for the confusion. I am proposing a budget of $12780.13 for this package.

User: Hi there! I'm really interested in the Romantic Escape Honeymoon Package. Could you please provide me with more details about the package and the price?
Agent: Hello! The Romantic Escape Honeymoon Package offers luxurious accommodation, convenient transportation, and delicious meals. It also includes romantic amenities such as Champagne and Chocolates, a private helicopter tour, a honeymoon photoshoot, a sunset cruise, a couples' spa retreat, a private starlit beach dinner, and another private helicopter tour. All of this can be yours for the excellent price of $19000. It's the perfect package to create unforgettable memories for your honeymoon!'
User: Thank you for your offer, but my budget is firm at $15665. Is there any way we can work with that budget?
Agent: I understand that your budget is firm at $15665. However, considering the services and amenities included in this package such as luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, champagne and chocolates, private helicopter tour, honeymoon photoshoot, sunset cruise, couples' spa retreat, and a private starlit beach dinner, it would not be possible to meet your budget of $15665. The current package is priced at $19000, but I can try to make some adjustments to see if we can work with a slightly lower budget. Let me check for any available discounts or alternative options that may suit your budget better.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. I really appreciate your effort in finding possible adjustments or alternative options to suit my budget better. Please let me know if there are any discounts or options available that can help bring the price closer to my proposed budget of $15665. I'm open to any suggestions that can still provide a memorable experience.
Agent: Thank you for your understanding. I will definitely explore all possible options and discounts to bring the price closer to your proposed budget of $15665. I will get back to you as soon as I have found some suitable alternatives that can still provide you with a memorable experience.
User: Yes, please explore all possible options and discounts to bring the price closer to my proposed budget. Thank you.
Agent: Thank you for your request. We will explore all possible options and discounts to bring the price closer to your proposed budget. We will get back to you with the updated details soon.

Conversation History:
User: Hi there! I'm really interested in the Eco Tour package. Could you please provide me with more details about the package and its pricing?
Agent: Hello! The Eco Tour package is a wonderful opportunity for you to immerse yourself in nature while also participating in various eco-friendly activities. The package includes accommodation, transportation, meals, guided nature walks, kayaking adventures, cycling tours, nature photography workshops, yoga and meditation sessions, local village visits, cultural exchanges, and volunteering opportunities. All of this is available to you at a price of $16500. It's a great way to explore the beauty of the natural world while also making a positive impact on the environment.
User: I would like to remove the Local Village Visit from the package as it does not interest me.
Agent: I understand that the Local Village Visit doesn't interest you. If you are looking for a more budget-friendly option, I would recommend the Cultural Exchange service, which will bring down the cost of the tour to $16500.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Cultural Exchange service.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Cultural Exchange service.
User: I would like to add a Kayaking Adventure to the package.
Agent: Absolutely, adding the Kayaking Adventure to the package will bring the tour cost to $17330. It's a fantastic addition!
User: I appreciate the addition of the Kayaking Adventure to the package, but I'm afraid that it will exceed my proposed budget of $12,164. Is there any way we can find a middle ground or make some adjustments to accommodate my budget?
Agent: I understand that you have a specific budget in mind. Let me see what adjustments can be made to accommodate your budget without compromising on the overall experience. I will work on finding a middle ground and get back to you with the revised proposal. Thank you for your patience.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. I appreciate your efforts in finding a middle ground and I look forward to hearing back from you with the revised proposal.
Agent: Thank you for your understanding. I will work on finding a revised proposal that fits within your budget constraints. I appreciate your patience and look forward to getting back to you soon.
User: Yes, I understand. Please find a revised proposal within my budget constraints. Thank you for your assistance.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will provide you with a revised proposal that aligns with your budget constraints. Our team will work on it and send it to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your cooperation and assistance.
User: Thank you for understanding. I appreciate your effort in providing a revised proposal within my budget constraints. I look forward to receiving it and reviewing the details.
Agent: nan
Current Utterance: User: I understand that the agent is offering a tour package, but my budget is $11781.00177193143. Can we work out a deal within that range?

Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, I cannot lower the price to $9020.28 for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $10500 for the package, which is the lowest I can go. This package includes all the services and amenities mentioned earlier. I assure you that it is a great deal considering the experiences and services provided.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While the discounted price of $10500 is tempting, it is still higher than my proposed budget of $9020.28. Is there any possibility for further negotiation or customization of the package to meet my budget?

User: Hi there, I'm interested in purchasing the Culinary Tour package. Can you please provide me with information on the package and its price?
Agent: Hello, the Culinary Tour package is a food lover's dream come true. It includes accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to take part in a Foodie Walking Tour, visit a Spice Garden, participate in Culinary Workshops, go on a Market Tour, and experience a Farm-to-Table dining experience. This amazing package is priced at $12500. It's a fantastic opportunity to indulge in the local cuisine and immerse yourself in the culinary culture of the destination.
User: I am a food lover, so I would like to add the amenity Foodie Walking Tour to the package.
Agent: Absolutely, adding the Foodie Walking Tour amenity would be a great choice for a food lover like you. The total cost of the tour package with this addition is $12900.
User: I appreciate the offer, but $9020.28 is the highest I can go for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. Can we make a deal at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, I cannot lower the price to $9020.28 for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $10500 for the package, which is the lowest I can go. This package includes all the services and amenities mentioned earlier. I assure you that it is a great deal considering the experiences and services provided.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While the discounted price of $10500 is tempting, it is still higher than my proposed budget of $9020.28. Is there any possibility for further negotiation or customization of the package to meet my budget?
Agent: I appreciate your understanding, and I understand your budget constraints. Although I cannot meet your proposed budget of $9020.28, I can offer you a customized package for $12041.31. This price takes into consideration the various components of the tour package and strives to provide you with the best value for your money. Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or requirements that I can take into account while customizing the package further.
User: I don't have any interest in the Farm-to-table Experience, so please remove it from the package.
Agent: Since your budget is $0, we understand that you have financial constraints. We can remove the Farm-to-table Experience from the package. However, there is a low-budget alternative available for you, which is Food pairing. This option will lower down the price of the tour to $12041.31.
User: No, I would prefer to keep the Farm-to-table Experience in the package.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Farm-to-table Experience in the package.
User: Thank you for including the Farm-to-Table Experience in the package. However, I would still like to negotiate the price as my budget is $8930.28. Can you provide any further concessions?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our Farm-to-Table Experience. We understand your budget constraints, and we can offer you a discounted price of $11951.31 for the package.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for the discounted offer of $11951.31. However, my budget allows for a maximum of $9269.90. Could we possibly negotiate a lower price?

User: Hi there, I'm interested in purchasing the Culinary Tour package. Can you please provide me with information on the package and its price?
Agent: Hello, the Culinary Tour package is a food lover's dream come true. It includes accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to take part in a Foodie Walking Tour, visit a Spice Garden, participate in Culinary Workshops, go on a Market Tour, and experience a Farm-to-Table dining experience. This amazing package is priced at $12500. It's a fantastic opportunity to indulge in the local cuisine and immerse yourself in the culinary culture of the destination.
User: I am a food lover, so I would like to add the amenity Foodie Walking Tour to the package.
Agent: Absolutely, adding the Foodie Walking Tour amenity would be a great choice for a food lover like you. The total cost of the tour package with this addition is $12900.
User: I appreciate the offer, but $9020.28 is the highest I can go for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. Can we make a deal at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, I cannot lower the price to $9020.28 for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $10500 for the package, which is the lowest I can go. This package includes all the services and amenities mentioned earlier. I assure you that it is a great deal considering the experiences and services provided.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While the discounted price of $10500 is tempting, it is still higher than my proposed budget of $9020.28. Is there any possibility for further negotiation or customization of the package to meet my budget?
Agent: I appreciate your understanding, and I understand your budget constraints. Although I cannot meet your proposed budget of $9020.28, I can offer you a customized package for $12041.31. This price takes into consideration the various components of the tour package and strives to provide you with the best value for your money. Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or requirements that I can take into account while customizing the package further.
User: I don't have any interest in the Farm-to-table Experience, so please remove it from the package.
Agent: Since your budget is $0, we understand that you have financial constraints. We can remove the Farm-to-table Experience from the package. However, there is a low-budget alternative available for you, which is Food pairing. This option will lower down the price of the tour to $12041.31.
User: No, I would prefer to keep the Farm-to-table Experience in the package.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Farm-to-table Experience in the package.
User: Thank you for including the Farm-to-Table Experience in the package. However, I would still like to negotiate the price as my budget is $8930.28. Can you provide any further concessions?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our Farm-to-Table Experience. We understand your budget constraints, and we can offer you a discounted price of $11951.31 for the package.
User: Thank you for the discounted offer of $11951.31. However, my budget allows for a maximum of $9269.90. Could we possibly negotiate a lower price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the services and amenities included in this package, it is already discounted. I'm afraid I won't be able to negotiate further. However, I can offer you alternative options within your budget that still provide a wonderful culinary experience.
User: What type of accommodation is included in the Culinary Tour package?
Agent: The Culinary Tour package includes accommodation, but the specific type of accommodation is not mentioned.
User: I understand that the Culinary Tour package includes accommodation, but my budget for the entire package is $9498.58. Can we work within this budget?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in the Culinary Tour package, it would not be possible to adjust the price to $9498.58. However, I can offer you a discounted rate of $10500 for the package. This way, you can still enjoy the Foodie Walking Tour, Spice Garden Visit, Culinary Workshops, Market Tour, Farm-to-Table Experience, and Food Pairing activities within your budget.
Current Utterance: User: I appreciate the discounted rate of $10500, but unfortunately, my budget for the tour package is $9714.66. Can we find a middle ground between your discounted rate and my budget?

Agent: Absolutely, adding the Foodie Walking Tour amenity would be a great choice for a food lover like you. The total cost of the tour package with this addition is $12900.
User: I appreciate the offer, but $9020.28 is the highest I can go for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. Can we make a deal at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, I cannot lower the price to $9020.28 for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $10500 for the package, which is the lowest I can go. This package includes all the services and amenities mentioned earlier. I assure you that it is a great deal considering the experiences and services provided.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While the discounted price of $10500 is tempting, it is still higher than my proposed budget of $9020.28. Is there any possibility for further negotiation or customization of the package to meet my budget?
Agent: I appreciate your understanding, and I understand your budget constraints. Although I cannot meet your proposed budget of $9020.28, I can offer you a customized package for $12041.31. This price takes into consideration the various components of the tour package and strives to provide you with the best value for your money. Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or requirements that I can take into account while customizing the package further.
User: I don't have any interest in the Farm-to-table Experience, so please remove it from the package.
Agent: Since your budget is $0, we understand that you have financial constraints. We can remove the Farm-to-table Experience from the package. However, there is a low-budget alternative available for you, which is Food pairing. This option will lower down the price of the tour to $12041.31.
User: No, I would prefer to keep the Farm-to-table Experience in the package.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Farm-to-table Experience in the package.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for including the Farm-to-Table Experience in the package. However, I would still like to negotiate the price as my budget is $8930.28. Can you provide any further concessions?

It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.38. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.38 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.23?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.11, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.23. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.11.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
Current Utterance: User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?

User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?

Intent Expert O/p:---> Since the user is asking about the possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to their initial budget, the intent is most clearly reflected in the user’s most recent message. The user is seeking a more flexible price adjustment, which aligns with the definition of Request_Additional_Info. The justification is based on the user's continued negotiation efforts and their desire to meet their initial budget.
Keyterm Expert O/p:---> User: Yes, I would like to remove the jet skiing activity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in jet skiing. I can remove that activity from the package. However, please note that this will lower the overall cost of the tour, which may affect other activities included in the package.
User: I would like to keep the jet skiing activity, but only for a limited number of times per week. Can we discuss this further?
Agent: I can discuss this with

User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.38. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.38 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.23?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.11, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.23. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.11.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more.
Current Utterance: User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.

Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.11.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more. I highly recommend considering this offer as it promises an unforgettable and enjoyable experience.
Current Utterance: User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.

User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.38. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.38 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.23?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.11, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.23. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.11.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more. I highly recommend considering this offer as it promises an unforgettable and enjoyable experience.
User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.
Agent: Thank you for your consent. We appreciate your understanding and will proceed with the current price of $19000 for the package.
Current Utterance: User: I'm really happy with the tour package offer. Let's go ahead with it, thanks!

Selected Experts: ['intent expert', 'keyterm expert', 'analyze_text']
Intent Expert O/p:---> Based on the conversation history and the user’s most recent message, I identify the intent as: 

Intent: Ask_Additional_Info  
Justification: The user is directly asking for a specific modification to the package, by expressing interest in adding the Scuba diving activity. This shows that they want more information about the package, rather than simply booking it or asking about the price. The user is also showing flexibility in their original budget and willingness to adjust their preferences, indicating that they are interested in exploring
Keyterm Expert O/p:---> As you mentioned earlier, the Scuba diving activity is included in the package. However, I need to clarify that the activity is not included in the room rate, but rather it is an additional cost. The cost of the Scuba diving activity is $1200 per person, which is already included in the overall price of the package. However, I can offer you a discount of $200 off the activity, bringing the total cost to $1000 per person.

User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
Current Utterance: User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?

Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?

Selected Experts: ['sentiment expert', 'persuasion expert', 'analyze_text', 'keyterm expert', 'get_svo_string']
Keyterm Expert O/p:---> User: No, I would prefer to accept your offer and proceed with the package. I would like to pay the remaining balance of $19000 minus the discount, which will be $19000 - $1900 = $17000. Please confirm if this is acceptable.
Agent: Thank you for your decision. We accept your offer and the remaining balance of $17000. You will be charged $17000 at checkout and your booking is confirmed. Please let us know if there's anything else
Sentiment Expert O/p:---> **Sentiment:** Negative
**Explanation:** Although the conversation starts with enthusiastic language, the tone gradually shifts to a repetitive and repetitive negotiation process, where the user and agent continually revisit the same price point, with the user expressing dissatisfaction and the agent trying to meet their budget. The repetition and frustration in the conversation ultimately contribute to a negative sentiment.
Persuasion Expert O/p:---> Given the current user utterance and the conversation history, the most suitable persuasion strategy that could be used is Personal Appeal.
Justification: The user has already shown interest in the package and is willing to negotiate and make compromises, indicating a strong desire to book the package. The agent should emphasize the popularity of the package and the value it offers to build trust and confidence in the booking decision.  

Future Strategy: Personal Appeal  
Justification: The user has shown strong interest and willingness to negotiate, indicating

User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more. I highly recommend considering this offer as it promises an unforgettable and enjoyable experience.
Current Utterance: User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.

User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.

Conversation History:
User: What meals are included in the Cultural Heritage Tour? What is included in the Education Tour package?
Agent: The Education Tour package includes accommodation, transportation, meals, educational visits, language classes, guided study sessions, academic lectures for visited sites, cultural immersion, books and study guides, and collaborative project mentorship.
User: I would like to enhance my learning experience, so please add Guided Study Sessions to the package.
Agent: Absolutely, adding Guided Study Sessions to the package will greatly enhance your learning experience. The final tour cost with this amenity is $18900.
User: I would like to remove the Cultural Immersion activity from the package as it is not something I am interested in.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in the Cultural Immersion activity. In that case, I would recommend the Collaborative Project mentorship as a low budget alternative. This will bring down the cost of the tour package to $18900.
User: No, I do not want to add the Collaborative Project mentorship as an alternative.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are not adding the Collaborative Project mentorship as an alternative.
User: I'm sorry, but I would really like to have the Collaborative Project mentorship included in the package. Can you please add it and let me know if the budget can be adjusted accordingly?
Agent: Adding the Collaborative Project mentorship to the package will increase the budget. After recalculating, the new budget for the package with the added amenity will be $20500. Please let me know if this fits within your budget.
User: I'm sorry, but I cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $14800.
Agent: I understand that you have a specific budget in mind. However, considering the comprehensive package we are offering which includes accommodation, transportation, meals, educational visits, language classes, and amenities such as guided study sessions, academic lectures, cultural immersion, and collaborative project mentorship, the package is priced at $18840. We believe this package will provide you with a valuable educational and cultural experience. If a lower budget is a concern, we can discuss alternatives and make adjustments accordingly.
User: Yes, I would like to proceed with the comprehensive package.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will proceed with the comprehensive package.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for considering my proposal. I look forward to experiencing the comprehensive package.

User: Thank you for adding Cultural workshops and demonstrations as an amenity. However, I must emphasize that my budget for the tour package is $9632 and I cannot exceed that amount. Can you work with this budget?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in the package, it is not possible to lower the price to $9632. However, I can offer you a discounted rate of $10500, which is the best I can do. This package will still provide you with a wonderful cultural experience and all the services you mentioned.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted rate of $10500, I'm afraid I won't be able to stretch my budget beyond $9632. Is there any possibility of further negotiation for a lower price?

User: What is included in the Festive Splendor: A Celebration Tour package?
Agent: This package includes accommodation, transportation, meals, festival events, traditional costume dress-up and photoshoot, cultural workshops and demonstrations, souvenir shopping assistance, local customs assistance, karaoke party, and cultural workshops and demonstrations.
User: What is included in the accommodation for Festive Splendor: A Celebration Tour?
Agent: The accommodation for the Festive Splendor: A Celebration Tour includes three nights of stay at a comfortable and luxurious hotel.
User: I'm not really interested in a Karaoke Party, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you're not interested in the Karaoke Party amenity. If your budget is $0, we can recommend a lower-cost alternative which is the Cultural workshops and demonstrations. This will bring down the price of the tour to $11400.

Agent: I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your offer of $9632. While I'm unable to go down to that exact price, I can offer you a discounted rate of $10,981. However, please understand that this is the lowest possible rate I can provide. Let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. However, I'm afraid that $10,981 is still a bit higher than what I had in mind. Is there any possibility of further negotiation or additional discounts?

Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
Current Utterance: User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?

Current Utterance: User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?

Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more. I highly recommend considering this offer as it promises an unforgettable and enjoyable experience.
Current Utterance: User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.

Conversation History:
User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more. I highly recommend considering this offer as it promises an unforgettable and enjoyable experience.
User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.
Agent: Thank you for your consent. We appreciate your understanding and will proceed with the current price of $19000 for the package.
Current Utterance: User: I'm really happy with the tour package offer. Let's go ahead with it, thanks!

User: What is included in the Festive Splendor: A Celebration Tour package?
Agent: This package includes accommodation, transportation, meals, festival events, traditional costume dress-up and photoshoot, cultural workshops and demonstrations, souvenir shopping assistance, local customs assistance, karaoke party, and cultural workshops and demonstrations.
User: What is included in the accommodation for Festive Splendor: A Celebration Tour?
Agent: The accommodation for the Festive Splendor: A Celebration Tour includes three nights of stay at a comfortable and luxurious hotel.
User: I'm not really interested in a Karaoke Party, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you're not interested in the Karaoke Party amenity. If your budget is $0, we can recommend a lower-cost alternative which is the Cultural workshops and demonstrations. This will bring down the price of the tour to $11400.
User: Ok I would like to add Cultural workshops and demonstrations as an amenity.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding Cultural workshops and demonstrations as an amenity.
User: Thank you for adding Cultural workshops and demonstrations as an amenity. However, I must emphasize that my budget for the tour package is $9632 and I cannot exceed that amount. Can you work with this budget?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in the package, it is not possible to lower the price to $9632. However, I can offer you a discounted rate of $10500, which is the best I can do. This package will still provide you with a wonderful cultural experience and all the services you mentioned.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted rate of $10500, I'm afraid I won't be able to stretch my budget beyond $9632. Is there any possibility of further negotiation for a lower price?

Agent: I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your offer of $9632. While I'm unable to go down to that exact price, I can offer you a discounted rate of $10,981. However, please understand that this is the lowest possible rate I can provide. Let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. However, I'm afraid that $10,981 is still a bit higher than what I had in mind. Is there any possibility of further negotiation or additional discounts?

Agent: I understand that you have a budget constraint, but the package I have proposed already includes several amenities and services that provide a unique wildlife experience. However, I can try to make some adjustments and provide you with accommodation options that can lower the cost to $24000. This is the best I can do considering the high-quality services and amenities included.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the effort to find accommodation options that can lower the cost. However, I can only afford $23087.92 for this package. Is there any way we can work around this price?

User: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the Wildlife Safari package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Wildlife Safari package offers guided safari tours, accommodation, and meals. It also includes amenities like birdwatching opportunities, photography workshops, wildlife viewing platforms, binoculars rental, camera rental, and a walking safari guide. The price for this package is $29250. It's a great opportunity to explore and experience the diverse wildlife in a thrilling safari adventure.'
User: I would prefer not to have a Walking safari guide included in the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback, I understand that the offered rate may still be higher than your budget. Allow me to make an adjustment for you. I can bring it down closer to your budget and offer you this package at $27337.5465392077.
User: I appreciate your adjustments, but I really cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $22466.216948215948. Is there any way you can further reduce the price?
Agent: I understand that you have a budget constraint, but the package I have proposed already includes several amenities and services that provide a unique wildlife experience. However, I can try to make some adjustments and provide you with accommodation options that can lower the cost to $24000. This is the best I can do considering the high-quality services and amenities included.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the effort to find accommodation options that can lower the cost. However, I can only afford $23087.92 for this package. Is there any way we can work around this price?
Agent: Thank you for your understanding. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, we cannot lower the price any further for this package. The current price of $27337.5465392077 is already discounted and reflects the best possible value for the services and amenities included. However, we can explore alternative options that may better fit your budget. Would you like me to suggest any other packages or destinations within your price range?
Current Utterance: User: I'm interested in birdwatching, so please add Birdwatching Opportunities to the package.

Current Utterance: User: I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid I cannot increase my budget beyond $23787.91551961812. Is there any possibility for a lower price or any other concessions?

This is the best I can do considering the high-quality services and amenities included.

Intent Expert O/p:---> Since you have a budget constraint, we can discuss possible options to lower the cost. One option could be to reduce the accommodation duration. We can offer you a 3-night stay instead of the original 5-night stay. This would bring the cost down to $23467.52. Alternatively, we can also consider removing some of the amenities and services to lower the cost. For example, we can remove the photography workshop and the birdwatching opportunities. This would bring the cost down to $

User: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the Wildlife Safari package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Wildlife Safari package offers guided safari tours, accommodation, and meals. It also includes amenities like birdwatching opportunities, photography workshops, wildlife viewing platforms, binoculars rental, camera rental, and a walking safari guide. The price for this package is $29250. It's a great opportunity to explore and experience the diverse wildlife in a thrilling safari adventure.
User: I would prefer not to have a Walking safari guide included in the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback, I understand that the offered rate may still be higher than your budget. Allow me to make an adjustment for you. I can bring it down closer to your budget and offer you this package at $27337.5465392077.
User: I appreciate your adjustments, but I really cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $22466.216948215948. Is there any way you can further reduce the price?
Agent: I understand that you have a budget constraint, but the package I have proposed already includes several amenities and services that provide a unique wildlife experience. However, I can try to make some adjustments and provide you with accommodation options that can lower the cost to $24000. This is the best I can do considering the high-quality services and amenities included.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the effort to find accommodation options that can lower the cost. However, I can only afford $23087.92 for this package. Is there any way we can work around this price?
Agent: Thank you for your understanding. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, we cannot lower the price any further for this package. The current price of $27337.5465392077 is already discounted and reflects the best possible value for the services and amenities included. However, we can explore alternative options that may better fit your budget. Would you like me to suggest any other packages or destinations within your price range?
Current Utterance: User: I'm interested in birdwatching, so please add Birdwatching Opportunities to the package.
Agent:

User: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the Wildlife Safari package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Wildlife Safari package offers guided safari tours, accommodation, and meals. It also includes amenities like birdwatching opportunities, photography workshops, wildlife viewing platforms, binoculars rental, camera rental, and a walking safari guide. The price for this package is $29250. It's a great opportunity to explore and experience the diverse wildlife in a thrilling safari adventure.
User: I would prefer not to have a Walking safari guide included in the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback, I understand that the offered rate may still be higher than your budget. Allow me to make an adjustment for you. I can bring it down closer to your budget and offer you this package at $27337.5465392077.
User: I appreciate your adjustments, but I really cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $22466.216948215948. Is there any way you can further reduce the price?
Agent: I understand that you have a budget constraint, but the package I have proposed already includes several amenities and services that provide a unique wildlife experience. However, I can try to make some adjustments and provide you with accommodation options that can lower the cost to $24000. This is the best I can do considering the high-quality services and amenities included.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the effort to find accommodation options that can lower the cost. However, I can only afford $23087.92 for this package. Is there any way we can work around this price?
Agent: Thank you for your understanding. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, we cannot lower the price any further for this package. The current price of $27337.5465392077 is already discounted and reflects the best possible value for the services and amenities included. However, we can explore alternative options that may better fit your budget. Would you like me to suggest any other packages or destinations within your price range?
User: I'm interested in birdwatching, so please add Birdwatching Opportunities to the package.
Agent: Absolutely! Adding the Birdwatching Opportunities amenity will enhance your experience. The total cost of the tour package, including this amenity, is $28037.5465392077.
Current Utterance: User: I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid I cannot increase my budget beyond $23787.91551961812. Is there any possibility for a lower price or any other concessions?

This package is truly worth the price and will provide you with a memorable beach vacation.
Current Utterance: User: No, I'm afraid that's still beyond my budget. Thank you for your offer though.

User: I appreciate the offer, but my budget is limited to $9349. Is there any way to adjust the package to fit within this budget?
Agent: I understand that you have a limited budget, but this tour package offers an amazing beachside experience with various water sports activities and amenities. Unfortunately, it would not be possible to adjust the package to fit within your budget of $9349. However, I can offer you a discounted rate of $10500, which is the best I can do. This package is truly worth the price and will provide you with a memorable beach vacation.
User: No, I'm afraid that's still beyond my budget. Thank you for your offer though.
Agent: I understand that the price is still a concern for you. I appreciate your consideration and if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with, please let me know.
User: I don't plan on participating in any water sports, so please remove the amenity Water sports equipment rental from the package.
Agent: We understand that you do not plan on participating in any water sports. Therefore, we can remove the amenity of Water sports equipment rental from the package. As an alternative, we can offer you a Beach umbrella rental, which will lower the price of the tour to $11450.
Current Utterance: User: No, I do not want to add Beach umbrella rental as an alternative.

User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more. I highly recommend considering this offer as it promises an unforgettable and enjoyable experience.
Current Utterance: User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.

Conversation History:
User: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the Wildlife Safari package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Wildlife Safari package offers guided safari tours, accommodation, and meals. It also includes amenities like birdwatching opportunities, photography workshops, wildlife viewing platforms, binoculars rental, camera rental, and a walking safari guide. The price for this package is $29250. It's a great opportunity to explore and experience the diverse wildlife in a thrilling safari adventure.'
User: I would prefer not to have a Walking safari guide included in the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback, I understand that the offered rate may still be higher than your budget. Allow me to make an adjustment for you. I can bring it down closer to your budget and offer you this package at $27337.5465392077.
User: I appreciate your adjustments, but I really cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $22466.216948215948. Is there any way you can further reduce the price?
Agent: I understand that you have a budget constraint, but the package I have proposed already includes several amenities and services that provide a unique wildlife experience. However, I can try to make some adjustments and provide you with accommodation options that can lower the cost to $24000. This is the best I can do considering the high-quality services and amenities included.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the effort to find accommodation options that can lower the cost. However, I can only afford $23087.92 for this package. Is there any way we can work around this price?

Conversation History:
User: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the Wildlife Safari package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Wildlife Safari package offers guided safari tours, accommodation, and meals. It also includes amenities like birdwatching opportunities, photography workshops, wildlife viewing platforms, binoculars rental, camera rental, and a walking safari guide. The price for this package is $29250. It's a great opportunity to explore and experience the diverse wildlife in a thrilling safari adventure.'
User: I would prefer not to have a Walking safari guide included in the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback, I understand that the offered rate may still be higher than your budget. Allow me to make an adjustment for you. I can bring it down closer to your budget and offer you this package at $27337.5465392077.
User: I appreciate your adjustments, but I really cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $22466.216948215948. Is there any way you can further reduce the price?
Agent: I understand that you have a budget constraint, but the package I have proposed already includes several amenities and services that provide a unique wildlife experience. However, I can try to make some adjustments and provide you with accommodation options that can lower the cost to $24000. This is the best I can do considering the high-quality services and amenities included.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the effort to find accommodation options that can lower the cost. However, I can only afford $23087.92 for this package. Is there any way we can work around this price?
Agent: Thank you for your understanding. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, we cannot lower the price any further for this package. The current price of $27337.5465392077 is already discounted and reflects the best possible value for the services and amenities included. However, we can explore alternative options that may better fit your budget. Would you like me to suggest any other packages or destinations within your price range?
Current Utterance: User: I'm interested in birdwatching, so please add Birdwatching Opportunities to the package.

User: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the Wildlife Safari package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Wildlife Safari package offers guided safari tours, accommodation, and meals. It also includes amenities like birdwatching opportunities, photography workshops, wildlife viewing platforms, binoculars rental, camera rental, and a walking safari guide. The price for this package is $29250. It's a great opportunity to explore and experience the diverse wildlife in a thrilling safari adventure.'
User: I would prefer not to have a Walking safari guide included in the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback, I understand that the offered rate may still be higher than your budget. Allow me to make an adjustment for you. I can bring it down closer to your budget and offer you this package at $27337.5465392077.
User: I appreciate your adjustments, but I really cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $22466.216948215948. Is there any way you can further reduce the price?
Agent: I understand that you have a budget constraint, but the package I have proposed already includes several amenities and services that provide a unique wildlife experience. However, I can try to make some adjustments and provide you with accommodation options that can lower the cost to $24000. This is the best I can do considering the high-quality services and amenities included.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the effort to find accommodation options that can lower the cost. However, I can only afford $23087.92 for this package. Is there any way we can work around this price?
Agent: Thank you for your understanding. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, we cannot lower the price any further for this package. The current price of $27337.5465392077 is already discounted and reflects the best possible value for the services and amenities included. However, we can explore alternative options that may better fit your budget. Would you like me to suggest any other packages or destinations within your price range?
User: I'm interested in birdwatching, so please add Birdwatching Opportunities to the package.
Agent: Absolutely! Adding the Birdwatching Opportunities amenity will enhance your experience. The total cost of the tour package, including this amenity, is $28037.5465392077.
Current Utterance: User: I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid I cannot increase my budget beyond $23787.91551961812. Is there any possibility for a lower price or any other concessions?

User: Hi there, I'm really interested in purchasing the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!'
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more. I highly recommend considering this offer as it promises an unforgettable and enjoyable experience.
User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.
Agent: Thank you for your consent. We appreciate your understanding and will proceed with the current price of $19000 for the package.
Current Utterance: User: I'm really happy with the tour package offer. Let's go ahead with it, thanks!

Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?

Agent: I understand that you have a budget constraint, but the package I have proposed already includes several amenities and services that provide a unique wildlife experience. However, I can try to make some adjustments and provide you with accommodation options that can lower the cost to $24000. This is the best I can do considering the high-quality services and amenities included.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the effort to find accommodation options that can lower the cost. However, I can only afford $23087.92 for this package. Is there any way we can work around this price?

Selected Experts: ['intent expert', 'sentiment expert', 'keyterm expert', 'analyze_text', 'get_svo_string']
Intent Expert O/p:---> The current user utterance is: "Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the effort to find accommodation options that can lower the cost. However, I can only afford $23087.92 for this package."

The final answer is: Intent: Ask_Price_or_CostJustification: The user is directly asking about the cost of the travel experience, specifying a specific price they are willing to pay ($23087.92), and inquiring about the possibility of finding a solution to stay
Keyterm Expert O/p:---> User: I will accept the price of $23087.92 if you can remove the Walking safari guide from the package.
Agent: I can remove the Walking safari guide from the package, but I need to inform you that it's a standard service included in the package. Removing it would change the package's structure and availability. However, I can offer you a different package option that includes a walking safari guide. The new package would be called the "Wildlife Explorer" package, which includes all
Sentiment Expert O/p:---> **Sentiment:** 
**Explanation:** The conversation revolves around price negotiations, budget constraints, and adjustments, which implies a tense and potentially stressful situation. Although the agent is accommodating and willing to make adjustments, the persistent back-and-forth between the user and the agent suggests a negative emotional tone. The user's repeated requests for a lower price and the agent's reluctance to lower the price further contribute to the overall negative sentiment.

User: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the Wildlife Safari package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Wildlife Safari package offers guided safari tours, accommodation, and meals. It also includes amenities like birdwatching opportunities, photography workshops, wildlife viewing platforms, binoculars rental, camera rental, and a walking safari guide. The price for this package is $29250. It's a great opportunity to explore and experience the diverse wildlife in a thrilling safari adventure.'
User: I would prefer not to have a Walking safari guide included in the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback, I understand that the offered rate may still be higher than your budget. Allow me to make an adjustment for you. I can bring it down closer to your budget and offer you this package at $27337.5465392077.
User: I appreciate your adjustments, but I really cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $22466.216948215948. Is there any way you can further reduce the price?
Agent: I understand that you have a budget constraint, but the package I have proposed already includes several amenities and services that provide a unique wildlife experience. However, I can try to make some adjustments and provide you with accommodation options that can lower the cost to $24000. This is the best I can do considering the high-quality services and amenities included.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the effort to find accommodation options that can lower the cost. However, I can only afford $23087.92 for this package. Is there any way we can work around this price?
Agent: Thank you for your understanding. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, we cannot lower the price any further for this package. The current price of $27337.5465392077 is already discounted and reflects the best possible value for the services and amenities included. However, we can explore alternative options that may better fit your budget. Would you like me to suggest any other packages or destinations within your price range?
Current Utterance: User: I'm interested in birdwatching, so please add Birdwatching Opportunities to the package.

Current Utterance: User: I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid I cannot increase my budget beyond $23787.91551961812. Is there any possibility for a lower price or any other concessions?
