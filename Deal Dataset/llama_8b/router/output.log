However, I can offer you an exclusive upgrade to a luxury hotel for the duration of your stay. This will come at an additional cost of $1,000 per person. If you're interested, I can send you a personalized quote with the details."

Conversation History:
User: Hey! I want to buy this Cultural Tour package. What will be the cost?
Agent: This package offers great services like Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, and Guided City Tours.
User: I would like to do some crafts. Please add a Crafts Workshop to the package.
Agent: Thanks for confirming. After adding the Crafts Workshop amenity, the final tour cost is $16,400.
User: I do not need a cooking experience with my tour. Please remove it from the package.
Agent: No problem. Instead, I recommend an alternative option: a Cultural Shopping Excursion. This will fit within your proposed budget and enhance your tour experience.
User: Okay, I would like to add the Cultural Shopping Excursion.
Agent: Thank you for confirming. We are adding the Cultural Shopping Excursion as an amenity.
User: I want this package, but I cannot increase my budget.
Agent: This experience is truly worth it. The updated price will be $18,000, which includes everything you requested. I assure you it's a great value for your budget.
User: That's beyond my budget. I can't go higher than $13,000. Sorry, but can you lower the price?
Agent: This package offers the best services in the locality. If you compare the cost with similar services, our rate of $16,000 is competitive.
User: Okay, I do not want to add any extra service.
Agent: No problem; we have removed the additional service from your package.
User: What type of accommodations are available in the Cultural Tour package?
Agent: This package provides excellent accommodations, transportation, meals, and city tours. You??ª?ll experience unique culture through guided city walks, culinary experiences, crafts workshops, city tour extensions, and a cultural shopping excursion.
User: I??ª?m willing to go a bit higher because of the added amenities, but I cannot exceed $13,000.
Agent: Consider the adventurous experience this package offers for you and your family. We can provide an accommodation option at a total cost of $12,000, which is well worth the price.
User: I think $13,400 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you please reduce the price to $12,000?
Agent: As per your request, if you can increase your budget slightly from $13,000 to $13,700, that would be the best feasible option we can offer.
Current Utterance: User: Sorry, I cannot go up to $16,000 for the package. $13,700 is the maximum I can offer. I hope you understand.

Extracted Keyterm: Package price  
Justification: The user is asking for the cost of the tour.
Extracted Keyterm: Language interpreter services  
Justification: The user wants to remove this service from the tour package.
Extracted Keyterm: Souvenir shopping service  
Justification: The agent suggests adding this service as an alternative.

Sentiment Expert O/p:---> **Sentiment:** Negative
**Explanation:** The user has explicitly expressed disinterest ("No, I am not interested") twice, and the agent's response does not address the user's concerns, contributing to a negative sentiment. The agent's recommendation of a souvenir shopping service to lower the cost is seen as an attempt to persuade rather than a genuine offer to address the user's needs, further indicating a negative sentiment. The user's clear disinterest and the agent's unsuccessful attempt to persuade indicate a negative

Sentiment Expert O/p:---> **Sentiment:** 
**Explanation:**  "interested", "lifetime memories", "beautiful package" suggest a positive sentiment. However, the removal of services and the negotiation ("I am not interested in the souvenir shopping service") indicate a neutral to slightly negative sentiment due to the practical discussions and removals. The overall tone leans towards being informative and helpful rather than expressing strong emotions, thus the sentiment is neutral.  The last part of the conversation seems to be a continuation of the previous discussion,

User: Thanks for the new proposal. Can I keep nature walks in the tour and also add Tasting Tours?
Agent: I can add nature walks as well, but you would need to provide a budget of $15,200 for this.
User: What about accommodation in the Wellness Retreat package?
Agent: This package ensures you enjoy your stay with services like yoga and meditation, healthy cuisine options, nature walks, healing therapies, relaxation areas, mindfulness spaces, spa access, and fitness classes.
User: Oh! Sir, this is really high. I can only go up to $12,400.
Agent: I can do this for $12,400. How about this proposal?
Current Utterance: User: That??ª?s very good!! I am interested in a package that includes a Morning Safari, Evening Safari, and Night Safari as Guided Safari Tours. It also includes accommodations like Tented Camp, Lodge, and Treehouse, as well as amenities like Binoculars rental, Camera rental, and Walking safari guide.

Justification: The user is asking for more details about the tourism sites available around India, which aligns with the Ask_Tour_Details intent, but the user's utterance "I don't think so" indicates skepticism about the current package, and the user's request to remove an option while keeping the rest is more about clarifying and adjusting the package rather than asking for general details. Therefore, the user's intent is better captured by Request_Additional_Info,

Conversation History:
User: Hey, I want to buy Festive Splendor: A Celebration Tour, how much will it cost?
Agent: Sir, the package price is $32,000, and it offers many amenities.
User: I like this package, but I can't go more than $8,700.
Agent: Please consider all the cultural immersion activities in the package. You will never regret choosing it, as we are providing great value for this price.
User: I don't think so. I can only spend $9,100, and I'm not sure if I like all the cultural immersion activities. Could you share more details about other tourism sites available around India? I'd love that too.
Agent: This package contains everything to provide you with a trip of a lifetime. We can offer an accommodation option, which will bring the package cost down to $8,800.
User: No, I do not like this option. I only want to remove it from the package, but the rest of the items should remain.
Agent: We are removing the service you suggested. The given package consists of all the facilities that will provide you with a beautiful trip to Taiwan. The price is also worth it, as it includes all the updated amenities you proposed.
User: This package is good for me, but I cannot increase my proposed budget.
Agent: We are happy that you liked our tour, but please reconsider your budget, as the actual price is $11,400.
User: It's not important for me to know about the culture of the city. You have to remove the amenity "Cultural Workshops and Demonstrations."
Agent: If you feel that learning about the culture is not important for you, I would recommend a better budget option for the tour, which is Souvenir Shopping Assistance. This will bring the whole package down to $11,400.
User: Okay, I would like to add Souvenir Shopping Assistance as an amenity.
Agent: Thanks for your consent. We are adding Souvenir Shopping Assistance as an amenity.

Conversation History:
User: Hey, I want to buy Festive Splendor: A Celebration Tour, how much will it cost?
Agent: Sir, the package price is $32,000, and it offers many amenities.
User: I like this package, but I can't go more than $8,700.
Agent: Please consider all the cultural immersion activities in the package. You will never regret choosing it, as we are providing great value for this price.
User: I don't think so. I can only spend $9,100, and I'm not sure if I like all the cultural immersion activities. Could you share more details about other tourism sites available around India? I'd love that too.
Agent: This package contains everything to provide you with a trip of a lifetime. We can offer an accommodation option, which will bring the package cost down to $8,800.
User: No, I do not like this option. I only want to remove it from the package, but the rest of the items should remain.
Agent: We are removing the service you suggested. The given package consists of all the facilities that will provide you with a beautiful trip to Taiwan. The price is also worth it, as it includes all the updated amenities you proposed.
User: This package is good for me, but I cannot increase my proposed budget.
Agent: We are happy that you liked our tour, but please reconsider your budget, as the actual price is $11,400.
User: It's not important for me to know about the culture of the city. You have to remove the amenity "Cultural Workshops and Demonstrations."
Agent: If you feel that learning about the culture is not important for you, I would recommend a better budget option for the tour, which is Souvenir Shopping Assistance. This will bring the whole package down to $11,400.
User: Okay, I would like to add Souvenir Shopping Assistance as an amenity.
Agent: Thanks for your consent. We are adding Souvenir Shopping Assistance as an amenity.
User: What about accommodation in Festive Splendor: A Celebration Tour?
Agent: Yes, sir. The package offers luxurious hotel accommodation.
User: No, sir. It's too expensive. I won't be able to afford that price.
Agent: This tour package has everything you will love. Stop thinking about the price and focus on the experience before making your decision.
Current Utterance: User: I don't care about the price, but it??ª?s too much for me. I cannot go above $9,500.
Agent:

However, there is a hint of positivity when the user and agent discuss adding more activities and the user expresses a desire for creative experiences, which slightly shifts the sentiment towards the positive side. Yet, the overall tone remains neutral due to the transactional nature of the conversation and the absence of emotive language expressing strong feelings of happiness, sadness, or frustration.

Sentiment Expert O/p:---> **Sentiment:** 
**Explanation:** 

Sentiment: Negative
Explanation: The conversation history indicates a series of back-and-forth negotiations where the user is repeatedly met with resistance from the agent, leading to frustration. Phrases such as "Sorry, the max limit is $8900", "We cannot go further than $11200", and the agent's repeated insistence on the value of the package ("it is worth $11200") convey a negative sentiment from the user's perspective. The
Persuasion Expert O/p:---> Future Strategy: [One of the six strategies]  
Justification: [1–2 line explanation]  

Output: 
Future Strategy: Logical Appeal  
Justification: The user is now budget-conscious and asking for a deal, suggesting a facts-based approach.  The agent should provide a clear, fact-based explanation for the deal or offer alternatives that justify the price. 
This is the correct answer. I have the correct answer.  I am not sure what else to do. I have no

Conversation History:
User: Hello, I'm interested in buying the Adventure Trekking Expedition package. Can you provide me with details about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello, the Adventure Trekking Expedition package offers accommodation, transportation, meals, guided treks, camping equipment rental, local guides, hot springs relaxation, cultural village visit, and adventure activities. The package is priced at $17600. It's a great opportunity to experience thrilling adventures and immerse yourself in the beauty of nature.
User: What type of accommodations are included in the Adventure Trekking Expedition package?
Agent: The Adventure Trekking Expedition package includes accommodations.
User: I would like to remove the Adventure activities from the package as I am not interested in participating in them.
Agent: I understand that you want to remove the Adventure activities from the package. As an alternative, I would recommend opting for just the Camping equipment rental, which will lower the price of the tour to $17600. This way, you can still enjoy the accommodation, transportation, meals, and guided treks within your budget.
User: I would like to have local guides included in the package as I would like to have a knowledgeable person show me around the area.
Agent: Absolutely, including local guides in your package is a great idea. The total cost of the tour with this amenity is $19045.
User: I understand the value of including local guides in the package, but my budget is fixed at $14330. Is there any way we can work within that budget?
Agent: I understand that your budget is fixed at $14330, but considering the value of including local guides, I can offer you this package at $16954.16832224629. Let me know if that works for you.
User: I appreciate your understanding, but I'm afraid I cannot go beyond my budget of $14330. Is there any possibility of adjusting the package to fit within my price range?
Agent: I understand your budget concerns, but I'm afraid we cannot go below our proposal of $16449.26. However, I can assure you that this package offers excellent value for money and includes several extra perks.
Current Utterance: User: I appreciate your understanding of my budget concerns. However, I really cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $14330. Is there any possibility for a further reduction or any other way to accommodate my budget?

User: Hi there, I am interested in purchasing the Adventure Trekking Expedition package. Could you please provide me with information about the package as well as the price?
Agent: Hello, the Adventure Trekking Expedition package offers accommodation, transportation, meals, guided treks, camping equipment rental, local guides, hot springs relaxation, cultural village visits, and adventure activities. All of this is included in the package price of $17600.
User: What type of accommodation is provided in the Adventure Trekking Expedition package?
Agent: The Adventure Trekking Expedition package provides accommodation options such as camping or staying in local lodges or guesthouses.
User: What meals are included in the Adventure Trekking Expedition package?
Agent: The Adventure Trekking Expedition package includes meals for the duration of the trip.
User: I would like to have local guides included in the package as I want to have a deeper understanding and knowledge of the places we will be visiting.
Agent: Absolutely, adding the amenity of Local guides will greatly enhance your experience and knowledge of the places you'll be visiting. The final tour cost, including Local guides, is $19100.
User: I appreciate the offer, but $19100 is still above my budget. I can only go up to $12136.588150651289. Is there any way we can work around this?
Agent: I understand your concern about the budget. While I cannot go down to $12136.588150651289, I can offer you a discounted rate of $16954.16832224629. This is the best I can do considering your budget limitations.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget limitations. However, $16954.16832224629 is still higher than what I can afford. My budget for the tour package is $12472.439065487026. Can we work with that price?
Agent: I understand your budget limitations and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm afraid that the package price of $16954.16832224629 is the best we can offer considering the services and amenities included. If you can increase your budget slightly to $14000, I can try to make some adjustments to accommodate your needs.
User: I think I would prefer to explore the destination on my own, so I would like to remove the amenity of Local guides from the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to explore the destination on your own and remove the amenity of Local guides from the package. As an alternative, we can offer Adventure activities which will lower down the price of the tour to $16954.16832224629.
Current Utterance: User: I apologize for the confusion. I am proposing a budget of $12780.13 for this package.

Conversation History:
User: Hi there, I am interested in purchasing the Adventure Trekking Expedition package. Could you please provide me with information about the package as well as the price?
Agent: Hello, the Adventure Trekking Expedition package offers accommodation, transportation, meals, guided treks, camping equipment rental, local guides, hot springs relaxation, cultural village visits, and adventure activities. All of this is included in the package price of $17600.
User: What type of accommodation is provided in the Adventure Trekking Expedition package?
Agent: The Adventure Trekking Expedition package provides accommodation options such as camping or staying in local lodges or guesthouses.
User: What meals are included in the Adventure Trekking Expedition package?
Agent: The Adventure Trekking Expedition package includes meals for the duration of the trip.
User: I would like to have local guides included in the package as I want to have a deeper understanding and knowledge of the places we will be visiting.
Agent: Absolutely, adding the amenity of Local guides will greatly enhance your experience and knowledge of the places you'll be visiting. The final tour cost, including Local guides, is $19100.
User: I appreciate the offer, but $19100 is still above my budget. I can only go up to $12136.588150651289. Is there any way we can work around this?
Agent: I understand your concern about the budget. While I cannot go down to $12136.588150651289, I can offer you a discounted rate of $16954.16832224629. This is the best I can do considering your budget limitations.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget limitations. However, $16954.16832224629 is still higher than what I can afford. My budget for the tour package is $12472.439065487026. Can we work with that price?
Agent: I understand your budget limitations and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm afraid that the package price of $16954.16832224629 is the best we can offer considering the services and amenities included. If you can increase your budget slightly to $14000, I can try to make some adjustments to accommodate your needs.
User: I think I would prefer to explore the destination on my own, so I would like to remove the amenity of Local guides from the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to explore the destination on your own and remove the amenity of Local guides from the package. As an alternative, we can offer Adventure activities which will lower down the price of the tour to $16954.16832224629.
User: I apologize for the confusion. I am proposing a budget of $12780.13 for this package.
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the services and amenities included in this package, it is not possible to lower the price to $12780.13. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $14000 for this package.
User: Yes, I agree to the discounted price of $14000 for this package.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will proceed with the discounted price of $14000 for this package.
Current Utterance: User: I appreciate the discounted price, but I'm afraid I can only afford $12780.132479102529. Is there any possibility of reducing the price further?

User: Hi there! I'm really interested in the Romantic Escape Honeymoon Package. Could you please provide me with more details about the package and the price?
Agent: Hello! The Romantic Escape Honeymoon Package offers luxurious accommodation, convenient transportation, and delicious meals. It also includes romantic amenities such as Champagne and Chocolates, a private helicopter tour, a honeymoon photoshoot, a sunset cruise, a couples' spa retreat, a private starlit beach dinner, and another private helicopter tour. All of this can be yours for the excellent price of $19000. It's the perfect package to create unforgettable memories for your honeymoon!'
User: Thank you for your offer, but my budget is firm at $15665. Is there any way we can work with that budget?
Agent: I understand that your budget is firm at $15665. However, considering the services and amenities included in this package such as luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, champagne and chocolates, private helicopter tour, honeymoon photoshoot, sunset cruise, couples' spa retreat, and a private starlit beach dinner, it would not be possible to meet your budget of $15665. The current package is priced at $19000, but I can try to make some adjustments to see if we can work with a slightly lower budget. Let me check for any available discounts or alternative options that may suit your budget better.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. I really appreciate your effort in finding possible adjustments or alternative options to suit my budget better. Please let me know if there are any discounts or options available that can help bring the price closer to my proposed budget of $15665. I'm open to any suggestions that can still provide a memorable experience.

Note: Since the user is not explicitly confirming the purchase, but rather expressing appreciation and interest in the agent's effort, the intent is still Confirm_Interest. However, the agent should respond with a message that clarifies the next steps and reiterates the interest
Sentiment Expert O/p:---> **Sentiment:** 

**Explanation:**  - There is a mix of positive and neutral sentiment throughout the conversation, primarily driven by the agent's enthusiastic description of the package and the user's polite and appreciative responses. However, the user's initial budget constraint and the agent's subsequent inability to meet that budget introduce a negative tone, as does the agent's implication that the package cannot be adjusted to fit the user's budget. Overall, the sentiment is somewhat mixed but leans towards a positive tone due

User: Hi there! I'm really interested in the Eco Tour package. Could you please provide me with more details about the package and its pricing?
Agent: Hello! The Eco Tour package is a wonderful opportunity for you to immerse yourself in nature while also participating in various eco-friendly activities. The package includes accommodation, transportation, meals, guided nature walks, kayaking adventures, cycling tours, nature photography workshops, yoga and meditation sessions, local village visits, cultural exchanges, and volunteering opportunities. All of this is available to you at a price of $16500. It's a great way to explore the beauty of the natural world while also making a positive impact on the environment.
User: I would like to remove the Local Village Visit from the package as it does not interest me.

Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Cultural Exchange service.

Agent: Absolutely, adding the Kayaking Adventure to the package will bring the tour cost to $17330. It's a fantastic addition!
User: I appreciate the addition of the Kayaking Adventure to the package, but I'm afraid that it will exceed my proposed budget of $12,164. Is there any way we can find a middle ground or make some adjustments to accommodate my budget?
Agent: I understand that you have a specific budget in mind. Let me see what adjustments can be made to accommodate your budget without compromising on the overall experience. I will work on finding a middle ground and get back to you with the revised proposal. Thank you for your patience.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. I appreciate your efforts in finding a middle ground and I look forward to hearing back from you with the revised proposal.
Agent: Thank you for your understanding. I will work on finding a revised proposal that fits within your budget constraints. I appreciate your patience and look forward to getting back to you soon.

Agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have any information about the Cultural Heritage Tour package. Could you please provide more details or ask about a different package?
User: I would like to have guided study sessions included in the package, as I would like to continue my studies while on the tour.
Agent: Sure, adding the amenity Guided Study Sessions will make the tour cost $18900.
User: I don't think I'll need the Guided Study Sessions during this tour, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you don't want the Guided Study Sessions for this tour. As an alternative, I recommend the Cultural Immersion package, which will lower the cost of the tour to $18900.
User: No, I do not want to add the Cultural Immersion package.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are removing the Cultural Immersion package.
User: I appreciate your understanding. Considering my budget, would it be possible to reduce the package price to $15620.92 by removing the Cultural Immersion package?
Agent: Thank you for your understanding. We can certainly make adjustments to meet your budget. I can offer you a revised package price of $18,500 by removing the Cultural Immersion package.
User: Thank you for the revised offer. However, my budget is $16053.191410161313. Is there any way we can work within that range?

Conversation History:
User: Hi there, I'm interested in purchasing the Culinary Tour package. Can you please provide me with information on the package and its price?
Agent: Hello, the Culinary Tour package is a food lover's dream come true. It includes accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to take part in a Foodie Walking Tour, visit a Spice Garden, participate in Culinary Workshops, go on a Market Tour, and experience a Farm-to-Table dining experience. This amazing package is priced at $12500. It's a fantastic opportunity to indulge in the local cuisine and immerse yourself in the culinary culture of the destination.
User: I am a food lover, so I would like to add the amenity Foodie Walking Tour to the package.
Agent: Absolutely, adding the Foodie Walking Tour amenity would be a great choice for a food lover like you. The total cost of the tour package with this addition is $12900.
User: I appreciate the offer, but $9020.28 is the highest I can go for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. Can we make a deal at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, I cannot lower the price to $9020.28 for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $10500 for the package, which is the lowest I can go. This package includes all the services and amenities mentioned earlier. I assure you that it is a great deal considering the experiences and services provided.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While the discounted price of $10500 is tempting, it is still higher than my proposed budget of $9020.28. Is there any possibility for further negotiation or customization of the package to meet my budget?
Agent: I appreciate your understanding, and I understand your budget constraints. Although I cannot meet your proposed budget of $9020.28, I can offer you a customized package for $12041.31. This price takes into consideration the various components of the tour package and strives to provide you with the best value for your money. Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or requirements that I can take into account while customizing the package further.
User: I don't have any interest in the Farm-to-table Experience, so please remove it from the package.
Agent: Since your budget is $0, we understand that you have financial constraints. We can remove the Farm-to-table Experience from the package. However, there is a low-budget alternative available for you, which is Food pairing. This option will lower down the price of the tour to $12041.31.
User: No, I would prefer to keep the Farm-to-table Experience in the package.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Farm-to-table Experience in the package.
User: Thank you for including the Farm-to-Table Experience in the package. However, I would still like to negotiate the price as my budget is $8930.28. Can you provide any further concessions?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our Farm-to-Table Experience. We understand your budget constraints, and we can offer you a discounted price of $11951.31 for the package.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for the discounted offer of $11951.31. However, my budget allows for a maximum of $9269.90. Could we possibly negotiate a lower price?

Conversation History:
User: Hi there, I'm interested in purchasing the Culinary Tour package. Can you please provide me with information on the package and its price?
Agent: Hello, the Culinary Tour package is a food lover's dream come true. It includes accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to take part in a Foodie Walking Tour, visit a Spice Garden, participate in Culinary Workshops, go on a Market Tour, and experience a Farm-to-Table dining experience. This amazing package is priced at $12500. It's a fantastic opportunity to indulge in the local cuisine and immerse yourself in the culinary culture of the destination.
User: I am a food lover, so I would like to add the amenity Foodie Walking Tour to the package.
Agent: Absolutely, adding the Foodie Walking Tour amenity would be a great choice for a food lover like you. The total cost of the tour package with this addition is $12900.
User: I appreciate the offer, but $9020.28 is the highest I can go for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. Can we make a deal at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, I cannot lower the price to $9020.28 for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $10500 for the package, which is the lowest I can go. This package includes all the services and amenities mentioned earlier. I assure you that it is a great deal considering the experiences and services provided.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While the discounted price of $10500 is tempting, it is still higher than my proposed budget of $9020.28. Is there any possibility for further negotiation or customization of the package to meet my budget?
Agent: I appreciate your understanding, and I understand your budget constraints. Although I cannot meet your proposed budget of $9020.28, I can offer you a customized package for $12041.31. This price takes into consideration the various components of the tour package and strives to provide you with the best value for your money. Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or requirements that I can take into account while customizing the package further.
User: I don't have any interest in the Farm-to-table Experience, so please remove it from the package.
Agent: Since your budget is $0, we understand that you have financial constraints. We can remove the Farm-to-table Experience from the package. However, there is a low-budget alternative available for you, which is Food pairing. This option will lower down the price of the tour to $12041.31.
User: No, I would prefer to keep the Farm-to-table Experience in the package.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Farm-to-table Experience in the package.
User: Thank you for including the Farm-to-Table Experience in the package. However, I would still like to negotiate the price as my budget is $8930.28. Can you provide any further concessions?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our Farm-to-Table Experience. We understand your budget constraints, and we can offer you a discounted price of $11951.31 for the package.
User: Thank you for the discounted offer of $11951.31. However, my budget allows for a maximum of $9269.90. Could we possibly negotiate a lower price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the services and amenities included in this package, it is already discounted. I'm afraid I won't be able to negotiate further. However, I can offer you alternative options within your budget that still provide a wonderful culinary experience.
Current Utterance: User: What type of accommodation is included in the Culinary Tour package?

Conversation History:
User: Hi there, I'm interested in purchasing the Culinary Tour package. Can you please provide me with information on the package and its price?
Agent: Hello, the Culinary Tour package is a food lover's dream come true. It includes accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to take part in a Foodie Walking Tour, visit a Spice Garden, participate in Culinary Workshops, go on a Market Tour, and experience a Farm-to-Table dining experience. This amazing package is priced at $12500. It's a fantastic opportunity to indulge in the local cuisine and immerse yourself in the culinary culture of the destination.
User: I am a food lover, so I would like to add the amenity Foodie Walking Tour to the package.
Agent: Absolutely, adding the Foodie Walking Tour amenity would be a great choice for a food lover like you. The total cost of the tour package with this addition is $12900.
User: I appreciate the offer, but $9020.28 is the highest I can go for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. Can we make a deal at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, I cannot lower the price to $9020.28 for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $10500 for the package, which is the lowest I can go. This package includes all the services and amenities mentioned earlier. I assure you that it is a great deal considering the experiences and services provided.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While the discounted price of $10500 is tempting, it is still higher than my proposed budget of $9020.28. Is there any possibility for further negotiation or customization of the package to meet my budget?
Agent: I appreciate your understanding, and I understand your budget constraints. Although I cannot meet your proposed budget of $9020.28, I can offer you a customized package for $12041.31. This price takes into consideration the various components of the tour package and strives to provide you with the best value for your money. Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or requirements that I can take into account while customizing the package further.
User: I don't have any interest in the Farm-to-table Experience, so please remove it from the package.
Agent: Since your budget is $0, we understand that you have financial constraints. We can remove the Farm-to-table Experience from the package. However, there is a low-budget alternative available for you, which is Food pairing. This option will lower down the price of the tour to $12041.31.
User: No, I would prefer to keep the Farm-to-table Experience in the package.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Farm-to-table Experience in the package.
User: Thank you for including the Farm-to-Table Experience in the package. However, I would still like to negotiate the price as my budget is $8930.28. Can you provide any further concessions?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our Farm-to-Table Experience. We understand your budget constraints, and we can offer you a discounted price of $11951.31 for the package.
User: Thank you for the discounted offer of $11951.31. However, my budget allows for a maximum of $9269.90. Could we possibly negotiate a lower price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the services and amenities included in this package, it is already discounted. I'm afraid I won't be able to negotiate further. However, I can offer you alternative options within your budget that still provide a wonderful culinary experience.
User: What type of accommodation is included in the Culinary Tour package?
Agent: The Culinary Tour package includes accommodation, but the specific type of accommodation is not mentioned.
Current Utterance: User: I understand that the Culinary Tour package includes accommodation, but my budget for the entire package is $9498.58. Can we work within this budget?
Agent:

Sentiment Expert O/p:---> **Sentiment:** 

**Explanation:**  The conversation history contains a mix of positive and neutral language. The agent uses phrases like "food lover's dream come true," "fantastic opportunity," and "amazing package," which express enthusiasm and satisfaction. However, the users' responses, particularly their offers and counter-offers, indicate a more neutral or even slightly negative sentiment due to the negotiations and budget constraints. The agent's responses, while professional, occasionally imply a sense of limitation or inability to

User: Hi there, I'm interested in purchasing the Culinary Tour package. Can you please provide me with information on the package and its price?
Agent: Hello, the Culinary Tour package is a food lover's dream come true. It includes accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to take part in a Foodie Walking Tour, visit a Spice Garden, participate in Culinary Workshops, go on a Market Tour, and experience a Farm-to-Table dining experience. This amazing package is priced at $12500. It's a fantastic opportunity to indulge in the local cuisine and immerse yourself in the culinary culture of the destination.
User: I am a food lover, so I would like to add the amenity Foodie Walking Tour to the package.
Agent: Absolutely, adding the Foodie Walking Tour amenity would be a great choice for a food lover like you. The total cost of the tour package with this addition is $12900.
User: I appreciate the offer, but $9020.28 is the highest I can go for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. Can we make a deal at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, I cannot lower the price to $9020.28 for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $10500 for the package, which is the lowest I can go. This package includes all the services and amenities mentioned earlier. I assure you that it is a great deal considering the experiences and services provided.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While the discounted price of $10500 is tempting, it is still higher than my proposed budget of $9020.28. Is there any possibility for further negotiation or customization of the package to meet my budget?
Agent: I appreciate your understanding, and I understand your budget constraints. Although I cannot meet your proposed budget of $9020.28, I can offer you a customized package for $12041.31. This price takes into consideration the various components of the tour package and strives to provide you with the best value for your money. Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or requirements that I can take into account while customizing the package further.
User: I don't have any interest in the Farm-to-table Experience, so please remove it from the package.
Agent: Since your budget is $0, we understand that you have financial constraints. We can remove the Farm-to-table Experience from the package. However, there is a low-budget alternative available for you, which is Food pairing. This option will lower down the price of the tour to $12041.31.
User: No, I would prefer to keep the Farm-to-table Experience in the package.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Farm-to-table Experience in the package.
User: Thank you for including the Farm-to-Table Experience in the package. However, I would still like to negotiate the price as my budget is $8930.28. Can you provide any further concessions?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our Farm-to-Table Experience. We understand your budget constraints, and we can offer you a discounted price of $11951.31 for the package.
User: Thank you for the discounted offer of $11951.31. However, my budget allows for a maximum of $9269.90. Could we possibly negotiate a lower price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the services and amenities included in this package, it is already discounted. I'm afraid I won't be able to negotiate further. However, I can offer you alternative options within your budget that still provide a wonderful culinary experience.
User: What type of accommodation is included in the Culinary Tour package?
Agent: The Culinary Tour package includes accommodation, but the specific type of accommodation is not mentioned.
User: I understand that the Culinary Tour package includes accommodation, but my budget for the entire package is $9498.58. Can we work within this budget?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in the Culinary Tour package, it would not be possible to adjust the price to $9498.58. However, I can offer you a discounted rate of $10500 for the package. This way, you can still enjoy the Foodie Walking Tour, Spice Garden Visit, Culinary Workshops, Market Tour, Farm-to-Table Experience, and Food Pairing activities within your budget.
Current Utterance: User: I appreciate the discounted rate of $10500, but unfortunately, my budget for the tour package is $9714.66. Can we find a middle ground between your discounted rate and my budget?

Conversation History:
User: Hi there, I'm interested in purchasing the Culinary Tour package. Can you please provide me with information on the package and its price?
Agent: Hello, the Culinary Tour package is a food lover's dream come true. It includes accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to take part in a Foodie Walking Tour, visit a Spice Garden, participate in Culinary Workshops, go on a Market Tour, and experience a Farm-to-Table dining experience. This amazing package is priced at $12500. It's a fantastic opportunity to indulge in the local cuisine and immerse yourself in the culinary culture of the destination.
User: I am a food lover, so I would like to add the amenity Foodie Walking Tour to the package.
Agent: Absolutely, adding the Foodie Walking Tour amenity would be a great choice for a food lover like you. The total cost of the tour package with this addition is $12900.
User: I appreciate the offer, but $9020.28 is the highest I can go for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. Can we make a deal at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, I cannot lower the price to $9020.28 for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $10500 for the package, which is the lowest I can go. This package includes all the services and amenities mentioned earlier. I assure you that it is a great deal considering the experiences and services provided.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While the discounted price of $10500 is tempting, it is still higher than my proposed budget of $9020.28. Is there any possibility for further negotiation or customization of the package to meet my budget?
Agent: I appreciate your understanding, and I understand your budget constraints. Although I cannot meet your proposed budget of $9020.28, I can offer you a customized package for $12041.31. This price takes into consideration the various components of the tour package and strives to provide you with the best value for your money. Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or requirements that I can take into account while customizing the package further.
Current Utterance: User: I don't have any interest in the Farm-to-table Experience, so please remove it from the package.

User: Hi there, I'm interested in purchasing the Culinary Tour package. Can you please provide me with information on the package and its price?
Agent: Hello, the Culinary Tour package is a food lover's dream come true. It includes accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to take part in a Foodie Walking Tour, visit a Spice Garden, participate in Culinary Workshops, go on a Market Tour, and experience a Farm-to-Table dining experience. This amazing package is priced at $12500. It's a fantastic opportunity to indulge in the local cuisine and immerse yourself in the culinary culture of the destination.
User: I am a food lover, so I would like to add the amenity Foodie Walking Tour to the package.
Agent: Absolutely, adding the Foodie Walking Tour amenity would be a great choice for a food lover like you. The total cost of the tour package with this addition is $12900.
User: I appreciate the offer, but $9020.28 is the highest I can go for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. Can we make a deal at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, I cannot lower the price to $9020.28 for the tour package with the Foodie Walking Tour amenity. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $10500 for the package, which is the lowest I can go. This package includes all the services and amenities mentioned earlier. I assure you that it is a great deal considering the experiences and services provided.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While the discounted price of $10500 is tempting, it is still higher than my proposed budget of $9020.28. Is there any possibility for further negotiation or customization of the package to meet my budget?
Agent: I appreciate your understanding, and I understand your budget constraints. Although I cannot meet your proposed budget of $9020.28, I can offer you a customized package for $12041.31. This price takes into consideration the various components of the tour package and strives to provide you with the best value for your money. Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or requirements that I can take into account while customizing the package further.
User: I don't have any interest in the Farm-to-table Experience, so please remove it from the package.
Agent: Since your budget is $0, we understand that you have financial constraints. We can remove the Farm-to-table Experience from the package. However, there is a low-budget alternative available for you, which is Food pairing. This option will lower down the price of the tour to $12041.31.
Current Utterance: User: No, I would prefer to keep the Farm-to-table Experience in the package.

Intent: Request_Additional_Info  
Justification: The user is asking for an adjustment to the package after adding the Karaoke Party, indicating they need further information or clarification on the updated price to meet their budget.  |  Intent: Request_Additional_Info  
Justification:
Persuasion Expert O/p:---> Based on the conversation history and the current user utterance, I recommend the following:

Future Strategy: Logical Appeal  
Justification: The user is now actively trying to negotiate the price and has expressed a clear budget constraint, which calls for a logical appeal to explain the value-for-money reasoning behind the package and its services.  The agent should now provide detailed, factual information to justify the cost of the package.  The agent should also explain how the package offers the best value for the user's budget

Overall, the interaction is professional and attempts to find a mutually beneficial solution, leaning

Conversation History:
User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.38. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.38 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.23?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.11, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.23. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.11.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
Current Utterance: User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?

Conversation History:
User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.38. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.38 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.23?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.11, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.23. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.11.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?

User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.38. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.38 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.23?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.11, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.23. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.11.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more.
Current Utterance: User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.

User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.38. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.38 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.23?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.11, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.23. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.11.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?

Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more. I highly recommend considering this offer as it promises an unforgettable and enjoyable experience.
Current Utterance: User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.

User: I would like to enhance my learning experience, so please add Guided Study Sessions to the package.
Agent: Absolutely, adding Guided Study Sessions to the package will greatly enhance your learning experience. The final tour cost with this amenity is $18900.
User: I would like to remove the Cultural Immersion activity from the package as it is not something I am interested in.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in the Cultural Immersion activity. In that case, I would recommend the Collaborative Project mentorship as a low-budget alternative. This will bring down the cost of the tour package to $18900.
User: No, I do not want to add the Collaborative Project mentorship as an alternative.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are not adding the Collaborative Project mentorship as an alternative.
User: I'm sorry, but I would really like to have the Collaborative Project mentorship included in the package. Can you please add it and let me know if the budget can be adjusted accordingly?
Agent: Adding the Collaborative Project mentorship to the package will increase the budget. After recalculating, the new budget for the package with the added amenity will be $20500. Please let me know if this fits within your budget.
User: I'm sorry, but I cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $14800.
Agent: I understand that you have a specific budget in mind. However, considering the comprehensive package we are offering which includes accommodation, transportation, meals, educational visits, language classes, and amenities such as guided study sessions, academic lectures, cultural immersion, and collaborative project mentorship, the package is priced at $18840. We believe this package will provide you with a valuable educational and cultural experience. If a lower budget is a concern, we can discuss alternatives and make adjustments accordingly.
User: Yes, I would like to proceed with the comprehensive package.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will proceed with the comprehensive package.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for considering my proposal. I look forward to experiencing the comprehensive package.

**Explanation:**  This conversation seems to have a generally **Neutral** sentiment. The agents and users discuss various aspects of the tour packages in a factual and professional manner. While there are phrases that could suggest slight positivity (e.g., "absolutely," "greatly enhance"), they are largely balanced by the detailed discussion of costs, inclusions, and exclusions, which maintains a neutral tone. The conversation does not express strong emotions or sentiments, making it a good example
Persuasion Expert O/p:---> Future Strategy: [One of the six strategies]  
Justification: [1–2 line explanation]

Conversation History:
User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent:

Conversation History:
User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more. I highly recommend considering this offer as it promises an unforgettable and enjoyable experience.
Current Utterance: User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.

Conversation History:
User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more. I highly recommend considering this offer as it promises an unforgettable and enjoyable experience.
User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.
Agent: Thank you for your consent. We appreciate your understanding and will proceed with the current price of $19000 for the package.
Current Utterance: User: I'm really happy with the tour package offer. Let's go ahead with it, thanks!

Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
Current Utterance: User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?

User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?

User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more. I highly recommend considering this offer as it promises an unforgettable and enjoyable experience.
Current Utterance: User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.

Keyterm Expert O/p:---> Current Utterance: User: Can you provide me with more information about the activities I can do at the resort, such as scuba diving, jet skiing, and beach games, as well as any other activities that I can participate in?
 
Now, I need to extract keyterms and their justifications from the user's current utterance with the conversation history for context.

The final answer is:

Extracted Keyterm: Activities  
Justification: The user wants to know more about the
Sentiment Expert O/p:---> **Sentiment:** 

**Explanation:**  This conversation is primarily neutral as it involves a negotiation process between a customer and an agent, discussing prices and package details. The tone remains professional, and neither party expresses strong emotions or dissatisfaction. However, the agent's repeated offers and the customer's continuous negotiation suggest a neutral sentiment, as they are working towards finding a mutually acceptable price without expressing significant frustration or happiness. The agent's recommendation to consider the package as an "unforgettable and enjoyable experience" slightly

Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more. I highly recommend considering this offer as it promises an unforgettable and enjoyable experience.
User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.
Agent: Thank you for your consent. We appreciate your understanding and will proceed with the current price of $19000 for the package.
Current Utterance: User: I'm really happy with the tour package offer. Let's go ahead with it, thanks!

User: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the Wildlife Safari package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Wildlife Safari package offers guided safari tours, accommodation, and meals. It also includes amenities like birdwatching opportunities, photography workshops, wildlife viewing platforms, binoculars rental, camera rental, and a walking safari guide. The price for this package is $29250. It's a great opportunity to explore and experience the diverse wildlife in a thrilling safari adventure.'
User: I would prefer not to have a Walking safari guide included in the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?

Conversation History:
User: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the Wildlife Safari package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Wildlife Safari package offers guided safari tours, accommodation, and meals. It also includes amenities like birdwatching opportunities, photography workshops, wildlife viewing platforms, binoculars rental, camera rental, and a walking safari guide. The price for this package is $29250. It's a great opportunity to explore and experience the diverse wildlife in a thrilling safari adventure.'
User: I would prefer not to have a Walking safari guide included in the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback, I understand that the offered rate may still be higher than your budget. Allow me to make an adjustment for you. I can bring it down closer to your budget and offer you this package at $27337.5465392077.
User: I appreciate your adjustments, but I really cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $22466.216948215948. Is there any way you can further reduce the price?
Agent: I understand that you have a budget constraint, but the package I have proposed already includes several amenities and services that provide a unique wildlife experience. However, I can try to make some adjustments and provide you with accommodation options that can lower the cost to $24000. This is the best I can do considering the high-quality services and amenities included.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the effort to find accommodation options that can lower the cost. However, I can only afford $23087.92 for this package. Is there any way we can work around this price?
Agent:

Conversation History:
User: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the Wildlife Safari package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Wildlife Safari package offers guided safari tours, accommodation, and meals. It also includes amenities like birdwatching opportunities, photography workshops, wildlife viewing platforms, binoculars rental, camera rental, and a walking safari guide. The price for this package is $29250. It's a great opportunity to explore and experience the diverse wildlife in a thrilling safari adventure.'
User: I would prefer not to have a Walking safari guide included in the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback, I understand that the offered rate may still be higher than your budget. Allow me to make an adjustment for you. I can bring it down closer to your budget and offer you this package at $27337.5465392077.
User: I appreciate your adjustments, but I really cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $22466.216948215948. Is there any way you can further reduce the price?
Agent: I understand that you have a budget constraint, but the package I have proposed already includes several amenities and services that provide a unique wildlife experience. However, I can try to make some adjustments and provide you with accommodation options that can lower the cost to $24000. This is the best I can do considering the high-quality services and amenities included.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the effort to find accommodation options that can lower the cost. However, I can only afford $23087.92 for this package. Is there any way we can work around this price?
Agent: Thank you for your understanding. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, we cannot lower the price any further for this package. The current price of $27337.5465392077 is already discounted and reflects the best possible value for the services and amenities included. However, we can explore alternative options that may better fit your budget. Would you like me to suggest any other packages or destinations within your price range?
Current Utterance: User: I'm interested in birdwatching, so please add Birdwatching Opportunities to the package.

Conversation History:
User: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the Wildlife Safari package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Wildlife Safari package offers guided safari tours, accommodation, and meals. It also includes amenities like birdwatching opportunities, photography workshops, wildlife viewing platforms, binoculars rental, camera rental, and a walking safari guide. The price for this package is $29250. It's a great opportunity to explore and experience the diverse wildlife in a thrilling safari adventure.'
User: I would prefer not to have a Walking safari guide included in the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback, I understand that the offered rate may still be higher than your budget. Allow me to make an adjustment for you. I can bring it down closer to your budget and offer you this package at $27337.5465392077.
User: I appreciate your adjustments, but I really cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $22466.216948215948. Is there any way you can further reduce the price?
Agent: I understand that you have a budget constraint, but the package I have proposed already includes several amenities and services that provide a unique wildlife experience. However, I can try to make some adjustments and provide you with accommodation options that can lower the cost to $24000. This is the best I can do considering the high-quality services and amenities included.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the effort to find accommodation options that can lower the cost. However, I can only afford $23087.92 for this package. Is there any way we can work around this price?
Agent: Thank you for your understanding. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, we cannot lower the price any further for this package. The current price of $27337.5465392077 is already discounted and reflects the best possible value for the services and amenities included. However, we can explore alternative options that may better fit your budget. Would you like me to suggest any other packages or destinations within your price range?
User: I'm interested in birdwatching, so please add Birdwatching Opportunities to the package.
Agent: Absolutely! Adding the Birdwatching Opportunities amenity will enhance your experience. The total cost of the tour package, including this amenity, is $28037.5465392077.
Current Utterance: User: I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid I cannot increase my budget beyond $23787.91551961812. Is there any possibility for a lower price or any other concessions?

Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
Current Utterance: User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?

The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!'
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?

Conversation History:
User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!'
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent:

Conversation History:
User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!'
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more. I highly recommend considering this offer as it promises an unforgettable and enjoyable experience.
Current Utterance: User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.

Conversation History:
User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!'
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more. I highly recommend considering this offer as it promises an unforgettable and enjoyable experience.
User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.
Agent: Thank you for your consent. We appreciate your understanding and will proceed with the current price of $19000 for the package.
Current Utterance: User: I'm really happy with the tour package offer. Let's go ahead with it, thanks!

User: What meals are included in the Cultural Heritage Tour? What is included in the Education Tour package?
Agent: The Education Tour package includes accommodation, transportation, meals, educational visits, language classes, guided study sessions, academic lectures for visited sites, cultural immersion, books and study guides, and collaborative project mentorship.
User: I would like to enhance my learning experience, so please add Guided Study Sessions to the package.
Agent: Absolutely, adding Guided Study Sessions to the package will greatly enhance your learning experience. The final tour cost with this amenity is $18900.
User: I would like to remove the Cultural Immersion activity from the package as it is not something I am interested in.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in the Cultural Immersion activity. In that case, I would recommend the Collaborative Project mentorship as a low budget alternative. This will bring down the cost of the tour package to $18900.
User: No, I do not want to add the Collaborative Project mentorship as an alternative.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are not adding the Collaborative Project mentorship as an alternative.
User: I'm sorry, but I would really like to have the Collaborative Project mentorship included in the package. Can you please add it and let me know if the budget can be adjusted accordingly?
Agent: Adding the Collaborative Project mentorship to the package will increase the budget. After recalculating, the new budget for the package with the added amenity will be $20500. Please let me know if this fits within your budget.
User: I'm sorry, but I cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $14800.
Agent: I understand that you have a specific budget in mind. However, considering the comprehensive package we are offering which includes accommodation, transportation, meals, educational visits, language classes, and amenities such as guided study sessions, academic lectures, cultural immersion, and collaborative project mentorship, the package is priced at $18840. We believe this package will provide you with a valuable educational and cultural experience. If a lower budget is a concern, we can discuss alternatives and make adjustments accordingly.
User: Yes, I would like to proceed with the comprehensive package.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will proceed with the comprehensive package.

Conversation History:
User: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the Wildlife Safari package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Wildlife Safari package offers guided safari tours, accommodation, and meals. It also includes amenities like birdwatching opportunities, photography workshops, wildlife viewing platforms, binoculars rental, camera rental, and a walking safari guide. The price for this package is $29250. It's a great opportunity to explore and experience the diverse wildlife in a thrilling safari adventure.
User: I would prefer not to have a Walking safari guide included in the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?

Conversation History:
User: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the Wildlife Safari package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Wildlife Safari package offers guided safari tours, accommodation, and meals. It also includes amenities like birdwatching opportunities, photography workshops, wildlife viewing platforms, binoculars rental, camera rental, and a walking safari guide. The price for this package is $29250. It's a great opportunity to explore and experience the diverse wildlife in a thrilling safari adventure.
User: I would prefer not to have a Walking safari guide included in the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback, I understand that the offered rate may still be higher than your budget. Allow me to make an adjustment for you. I can bring it down closer to your budget and offer you this package at $27337.5465392077.
User: I appreciate your adjustments, but I really cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $22466.216948215948. Is there any way you can further reduce the price?
Agent: I understand that you have a budget constraint, but the package I have proposed already includes several amenities and services that provide a unique wildlife experience. However, I can try to make some adjustments and provide you with accommodation options that can lower the cost to $24000. This is the best I can do considering the high-quality services and amenities included.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the effort to find accommodation options that can lower the cost. However, I can only afford $23087.92 for this package. Is there any way we can work around this price?
Agent:

**Explanation:** The conversation history is filled with phrases like "great opportunity," "thrilling safari adventure," "appreciate your consent," and "I appreciate your feedback," which indicate a positive sentiment from the agent. The user also expresses appreciation, but there are moments of frustration and negotiation about the price, which are not strong enough to shift the overall sentiment to negative.

User: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the Wildlife Safari package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Wildlife Safari package offers guided safari tours, accommodation, and meals. It also includes amenities like birdwatching opportunities, photography workshops, wildlife viewing platforms, binoculars rental, camera rental, and a walking safari guide. The price for this package is $29250. It's a great opportunity to explore and experience the diverse wildlife in a thrilling safari adventure.
User: I would prefer not to have a Walking safari guide included in the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback, I understand that the offered rate may still be higher than your budget. Allow me to make an adjustment for you. I can bring it down closer to your budget and offer you this package at $27337.5465392077.
User: I appreciate your adjustments, but I really cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $22466.216948215948. Is there any way you can further reduce the price?
Agent: I understand that you have a budget constraint, but the package I have proposed already includes several amenities and services that provide a unique wildlife experience. However, I can try to make some adjustments and provide you with accommodation options that can lower the cost to $24000. This is the best I can do considering the high-quality services and amenities included.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the effort to find accommodation options that can lower the cost. However, I can only afford $23087.92 for this package. Is there any way we can work around this price?
Agent: Thank you for your understanding. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, we cannot lower the price any further for this package. The current price of $27337.5465392077 is already discounted and reflects the best possible value for the services and amenities included. However, we can explore alternative options that may better fit your budget. Would you like me to suggest any other packages or destinations within your price range?
Current Utterance: User: I'm interested in birdwatching, so please add Birdwatching Opportunities to the package.

This package is truly worth the price and will provide you with a memorable beach vacation.

User: Hello, I am interested in buying the Beach Getaway package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Absolutely! The Beach Getaway package is perfect for beach lovers and water sports enthusiasts. It includes beachside accommodation, delicious meals, and a wide range of water sports activities such as snorkeling, diving, surfing, and jet skiing. Additionally, you can enjoy sunset cruises, relax at beach bars, and have fun with beach bonfires. You can also rent beach umbrellas, chairs, and water sports equipment. All of this comes at a great price of $11450.
User: I appreciate the offer, but my budget is limited to $9349. Is there any way to adjust the package to fit within this budget?
Agent: I understand that you have a limited budget, but this tour package offers an amazing beachside experience with various water sports activities and amenities. Unfortunately, it would not be possible to adjust the package to fit within your budget of $9349. However, I can offer you a discounted rate of $10500, which is the best I can do. This package is truly worth the price and will provide you with a memorable beach vacation.
User: No, I'm afraid that's still beyond my budget. Thank you for your offer though.
Agent: I understand that the price is still a concern for you. I appreciate your consideration and if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with, please let me know.

Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands.

User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?

Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more. I highly recommend considering this offer as it promises an unforgettable and enjoyable experience.
Current Utterance: User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.

User: Hi there, I'm really interested in the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more. I highly recommend considering this offer as it promises an unforgettable and enjoyable experience.
User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.
Agent: Thank you for your consent. We appreciate your understanding and will proceed with the current price of $19000 for the package.
Current Utterance: User: I'm really happy with the tour package offer. Let's go ahead with it, thanks!

Conversation History:
User: What meals are included in the Cultural Heritage Tour? What is included in the Education Tour package?
Agent: The Education Tour package includes accommodation, transportation, meals, educational visits, language classes, guided study sessions, academic lectures for visited sites, cultural immersion, books and study guides, and collaborative project mentorship.
User: I would like to enhance my learning experience, so please add Guided Study Sessions to the package.
Agent: Absolutely, adding Guided Study Sessions to the package will greatly enhance your learning experience. The final tour cost with this amenity is $18900.
User: I would like to remove the Cultural Immersion activity from the package as it is not something I am interested in.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in the Cultural Immersion activity. In that case, I would recommend the Collaborative Project mentorship as a low-budget alternative. This will bring down the cost of the tour package to $18900.
User: No, I do not want to add the Collaborative Project mentorship as an alternative.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are not adding the Collaborative Project mentorship as an alternative.
User: I'm sorry, but I would really like to have the Collaborative Project mentorship included in the package. Can you please add it and let me know if the budget can be adjusted accordingly?
Agent: Adding the Collaborative Project mentorship to the package will increase the budget. After recalculating, the new budget for the package with the added amenity will be $20500. Please let me know if this fits within your budget.
User: I'm sorry, but I cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $14800.
Agent: I understand that you have a specific budget in mind. However, considering the comprehensive package we are offering which includes accommodation, transportation, meals, educational visits, language classes, and amenities such as guided study sessions, academic lectures, cultural immersion, and collaborative project mentorship, the package is priced at $18840. We believe this package will provide you with a valuable educational and cultural experience. If a lower budget is a concern, we can discuss alternatives and make adjustments accordingly.
User: Yes, I would like to proceed with the comprehensive package.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will proceed with the comprehensive package.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for considering my proposal. I look forward to experiencing the comprehensive package.

Conversation History:
User: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the Wildlife Safari package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Wildlife Safari package offers guided safari tours, accommodation, and meals. It also includes amenities like birdwatching opportunities, photography workshops, wildlife viewing platforms, binoculars rental, camera rental, and a walking safari guide. The price for this package is $29250. It's a great opportunity to explore and experience the diverse wildlife in a thrilling safari adventure.'
User: I would prefer not to have a Walking safari guide included in the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback, I understand that the offered rate may still be higher than your budget. Allow me to make an adjustment for you. I can bring it down closer to your budget and offer you this package at $27337.5465392077.
User: I appreciate your adjustments, but I really cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $22466.216948215948. Is there any way you can further reduce the price?
Agent: I understand that you have a budget constraint, but the package I have proposed already includes several amenities and services that provide a unique wildlife experience. However, I can try to make some adjustments and provide you with accommodation options that can lower the cost to $24000. This is the best I can do considering the high-quality services and amenities included.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the effort to find accommodation options that can lower the cost. However, I can only afford $23087.92 for this package. Is there any way we can work around this price?
Agent:

User: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the Wildlife Safari package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Wildlife Safari package offers guided safari tours, accommodation, and meals. It also includes amenities like birdwatching opportunities, photography workshops, wildlife viewing platforms, binoculars rental, camera rental, and a walking safari guide. The price for this package is $29250. It's a great opportunity to explore and experience the diverse wildlife in a thrilling safari adventure.'
User: I would prefer not to have a Walking safari guide included in the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback, I understand that the offered rate may still be higher than your budget. Allow me to make an adjustment for you. I can bring it down closer to your budget and offer you this package at $27337.5465392077.
User: I appreciate your adjustments, but I really cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $22466.216948215948. Is there any way you can further reduce the price?
Agent: I understand that you have a budget constraint, but the package I have proposed already includes several amenities and services that provide a unique wildlife experience. However, I can try to make some adjustments and provide you with accommodation options that can lower the cost to $24000. This is the best I can do considering the high-quality services and amenities included.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the effort to find accommodation options that can lower the cost. However, I can only afford $23087.92 for this package. Is there any way we can work around this price?
Agent: Thank you for your understanding. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, we cannot lower the price any further for this package. The current price of $27337.5465392077 is already discounted and reflects the best possible value for the services and amenities included. However, we can explore alternative options that may better fit your budget. Would you like me to suggest any other packages or destinations within your price range?

Selected Experts: ['intent expert', 'keyterm expert', 'analyze_text']
Intent Expert O/p:---> Intent: 
Justification:  The user is asking about adjusting the package price to fit their budget, which indicates a need for further negotiation or adjustment of the original offer. This aligns with the Request_Additional_Info intent, as the user is asking for clarification on a specific aspect of the travel package and its pricing. However, it is closer to the Ask_Price_or_Cost intent as the user is directly asking about the price and wants to confirm if it can be adjusted to fit their budget
Keyterm Expert O/p:---> User Utterance: Can you please provide me with the details of the Mountain Resort package and its cost after adding snowboarding as an amenity?

Extract all relevant keyterms mentioned or implied in the user's message.
For each keyterm, provide a brief 1-line justification for why it's relevant in the tourism domain.

Here is my output for the problem:
Extracted Keyterm: Mountain Resort package  
Justification: The user is inquiring about a specific tourism package offering accommodation, activities

User: Hi there, I'm really interested in purchasing the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!'
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
Current Utterance: User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?

I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
Current Utterance: User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?

Conversation History:
User: Hi there, I'm really interested in purchasing the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!'
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?

User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
Current Utterance: User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?

Conversation History:
User: Hi there, I'm really interested in purchasing the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!'
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more. I highly recommend considering this offer as it promises an unforgettable and enjoyable experience.
Current Utterance: User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.

Conversation History:
User: Hi there, I'm really interested in purchasing the Beach Resort package. Can you please provide me with more information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Beach Resort package offers luxurious accommodation, transportation, and meals. You will have the opportunity to enjoy various activities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and exploring the islands. The package also includes access to a kids club, beachfront lounging, and scooter rentals. All of this is available for a budget-friendly price of $21900. It's the perfect getaway for beach lovers and adventure seekers!'
User: I appreciate the offer and the inclusion of scuba diving in the updated amenities. However, I have a budget of $15567 and I cannot go beyond that. Can you offer any concessions to accommodate my budget?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback and your interest in our updated amenities. We understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a concession and accommodate your budget by offering this package at $21096.379900976917. I hope this meets your expectations and allows you to enjoy all the wonderful experiences we have to offer.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. While I appreciate the concession, $21096.379900976917 is still beyond my budget. Can we possibly consider a price closer to $16138.230779976819?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. I can lower the price to $20468.111767817045, which is closer to your proposed price of $16138.230779976819. What do you say about this offer?
User: I'm not interested in beach games, so please remove that amenity from the package.
Agent: I understand that you are not interested in beach games. In that case, I can remove that amenity from the package. An alternative option to consider within your budget is the Scuba diving activity, which will lower the overall cost of the tour to $20468.111767817045.
User: Yes, I would like to add the Scuba diving activity instead.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we are adding the Scuba diving activity.
User: I appreciate the offer to add Scuba diving, but my budget for the tour package is $16584.82. Can we work with that?
Agent: Thank you for considering the offer to include Scuba diving in your tour package. I understand that your budget is $16584.82 and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle and I can offer you this package for $20478.11.
User: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go up to $16993.96 for this package. Can we meet in the middle at that price?
Agent: I understand your budget constraints, but considering the extensive services and amenities included in this package, it would be difficult for us to meet in the middle at $16993.96. However, I can offer you a discounted price of $19000 for this package. This way, you can still enjoy the amazing Accommodation, Transportation, Meals, Island Excursions, and all the other amenities it offers within your budget.
User: Thank you for understanding my budget constraints. While I appreciate the discounted price of $19000, it is still a bit higher than what I had originally proposed. Is there any possibility of further negotiation to meet closer to my initial budget of $16993.96?
Agent: Thank you for expressing your budget constraints. While I understand your concern, I'm afraid it would be difficult to further negotiate the price down to $16993.96. The current discounted price of $19000 is already a significant reduction from the original budget. However, I assure you that this package offers exceptional value for the services provided, including luxurious accommodation, transportation, meals, island excursions, and a wide range of amenities such as scuba diving, beach games, jet skiing, and more. I highly recommend considering this offer as it promises an unforgettable and enjoyable experience.
User: Yes, I understand and appreciate the value of the package. I will go ahead and give my consent to the current price of $19000.
Agent: Thank you for your consent. We appreciate your understanding and will proceed with the current price of $19000 for the package.
Current Utterance: User: I'm really happy with the tour package offer. Let's go ahead with it, thanks!

User: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the Wildlife Safari package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Wildlife Safari package offers guided safari tours, accommodation, and meals. It also includes amenities like birdwatching opportunities, photography workshops, wildlife viewing platforms, binoculars rental, camera rental, and a walking safari guide. The price for this package is $29250. It's a great opportunity to explore and experience the diverse wildlife in a thrilling safari adventure.'
User: I would prefer not to have a Walking safari guide included in the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback, I understand that the offered rate may still be higher than your budget. Allow me to make an adjustment for you. I can bring it down closer to your budget and offer you this package at $27337.5465392077.
Current Utterance: User: I appreciate your adjustments, but I really cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $22466.216948215948. Is there any way you can further reduce the price?

Agent: Thank you for your understanding. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, we cannot lower the price any further for this package. The current price of $27337.5465392077 is already discounted and reflects the best possible value for the services and amenities included. However, we can explore alternative options that may better fit your budget. Would you like me to suggest any other packages or destinations within your price range?
Current Utterance: User: I'm interested in birdwatching, so please add Birdwatching Opportunities to the package.

User: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the Wildlife Safari package. Can you please provide me with information about the package and its price?
Agent: Hello! The Wildlife Safari package offers guided safari tours, accommodation, and meals. It also includes amenities like birdwatching opportunities, photography workshops, wildlife viewing platforms, binoculars rental, camera rental, and a walking safari guide. The price for this package is $29250. It's a great opportunity to explore and experience the diverse wildlife in a thrilling safari adventure.'
User: I would prefer not to have a Walking safari guide included in the package.
Agent: I understand that you would like to remove the Walking safari guide from the package due to budget constraints. As an alternative, we can remove the Walking safari guide and adjust the package cost accordingly. The updated price for the tour package without the Walking safari guide would be $29250. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User: No, I do not want to remove the Walking safari guide.
Agent: Thanks for your consent, we will keep the Walking safari guide as a service.
User: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I would still like to negotiate the price. Can we make any adjustments to the package to meet my budget of $21621?
Agent: Thank you for your interest in our package. I understand that you would like to negotiate the price further. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I'm afraid we cannot go down to $21621. However, let me see if we can make any adjustments to the package to meet your budget. I can offer you a discounted rate of $28176.671785551363. Please let me know if this works for you.
User: Thank you for your understanding. I still find the offered rate of $28176.671785551363 to be higher than what I can afford. Is there any possibility of bringing it down closer to my budget of $22466.216948215948?
Agent: Thank you for your feedback, I understand that the offered rate may still be higher than your budget. Allow me to make an adjustment for you. I can bring it down closer to your budget and offer you this package at $27337.5465392077.
User: I appreciate your adjustments, but I really cannot go beyond my proposed budget of $22466.216948215948. Is there any way you can further reduce the price?
Agent: I understand that you have a budget constraint, but the package I have proposed already includes several amenities and services that provide a unique wildlife experience. However, I can try to make some adjustments and provide you with accommodation options that can lower the cost to $24000. This is the best I can do considering the high-quality services and amenities included.
User: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the effort to find accommodation options that can lower the cost. However, I can only afford $23087.92 for this package. Is there any way we can work around this price?
Agent: Thank you for your understanding. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, we cannot lower the price any further for this package. The current price of $27337.5465392077 is already discounted and reflects the best possible value for the services and amenities included. However, we can explore alternative options that may better fit your budget. Would you like me to suggest any other packages or destinations within your price range?
User: I'm interested in birdwatching, so please add Birdwatching Opportunities to the package.
Agent: Absolutely! Adding the Birdwatching Opportunities amenity will enhance your experience. The total cost of the tour package, including this amenity, is $28037.5465392077.
Current Utterance: User: I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid I cannot increase my budget beyond $23787.91551961812. Is there any possibility for a lower price or any other concessions?
