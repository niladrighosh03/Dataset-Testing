    "Persuasion Strategies:\n",
    "Credibility Appeal  \n",
    "Definition: Emphasize the travel company’s reputation, expertise, or trusted service.  \n",
    "Use when: The user is hesitant, asks about reliability, or mentions concerns about planning or quality.  \n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "\"Our agency has helped over 50,000 travelers experience Italy with top-rated local guides.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical Appeal  \n",
    "Definition: Use facts, comparisons, itineraries, or value-for-money reasoning to persuade.  \n",
    "Use when: The user is analytical, budget-conscious, or asking for detailed options.  \n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "\"This 7-day package includes 3 nights in Rome and 3 in Amalfi, plus high-speed train transfers—saving you both time and cost.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Persona-Based Appeal  \n",
    "Definition: Match the travel plan to the user’s interests, habits, or travel style.  \n",
    "Use when: The user reveals preferences like adventure, relaxation, family travel, or cultural focus.  \n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "\"Since you enjoy both history and scenic views, this tour combines ancient Rome exploration with peaceful coastal days.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Emotional Appeal  \n",
    "Definition: Tap into feelings like excitement, relaxation, or creating memorable experiences.  \n",
    "Use when: The user talks about dreams, bucket lists, family bonding, or once-in-a-lifetime experiences.  \n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "\"Imagine savoring gelato on the Spanish Steps, then watching the sunset over the Amalfi Coast.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Personal Appeal  \n",
    "Definition: Use positive sentiment, social proof, or popularity of a trip.  \n",
    "Use when: The user is unsure or looking for recommendations.  \n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "\"This is one of our most booked Italy packages—travelers love the perfect balance of city and coast.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Default Persuasion Strategy  \n",
    "Definition: Use when little context is available. Provide a neutral, reassuring recommendation.  \n",
    "Use when: The user is vague or hasn’t shared preferences yet.  \n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "\"We offer a variety of Italy trips with both guided and flexible options to suit different travel styles.\"\n",
