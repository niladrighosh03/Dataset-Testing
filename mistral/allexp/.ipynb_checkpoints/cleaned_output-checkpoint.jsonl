{"id_json": 31, "answer": "I understand that you're looking for a more detailed explanation of how a comprehensive insurance policy would cover your 2018 Honda CBR250R. Let's break it down. With a comprehensive policy, you'd be protected not only against third party liability, but also against damage to your own vehicle, such as theft, vandalism, or collision. This means that if your bike is stolen, damaged in an accident, or vandalized, your insurance would help cover the costs of repairs or replacement.
