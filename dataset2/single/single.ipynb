      "User: What's the premium for this level of coverage?\n",
      "Agent: For a 2018 Tesla Model 3 with comprehensive coverage, zero depreciation, and EV component protection, the annual premium would be around $3500. With features like cashless repair services, it streamlines the claim process, reducing administrative burdens and accelerating service delivery so vehicles can return to service faster.\n",
      "User: That sounds reasonable. What is the Insured Declared Value (IDV)?\n",
      "Agent: In the case of a total loss, this cover guarantees that the payout will match the original purchase price of the vehicle as per the invoice, rather than the depreciated current value, providing greater financial relief.\n",
      "User: Great. How do I proceed with purchasing this policy?\n",
      "Agent: Excellent! I can email you a detailed policy document and a link to our secure online payment portal.  Or, if you prefer, we can schedule a call to walk through the details together.

      "User: I need to renew my car insurance. It's for a 2010 Honda Civic.\n",
      "Agent: Okay, a 2010 Honda Civic. Are you primarily concerned with the lowest possible price, or are there specific coverages you're interested in?\n",
      "User: I'm on a fixed income, so price is definitely a factor. But I still need decent coverage.\n",
      "Agent: I understand. Itâ€™s important to protect yourself without breaking the bank. A third-party liability policy is the most affordable option, covering damages you might cause to others.\n",
      "User: What does that actually cover?\n",
      "Agent: It covers damages to another person's vehicle or property if you're at fault in an accident. It doesn't cover damages to your own car.\n",
      "User: Hmm, I see. How much would that cost?\n",
      "Agent: For a 2010 Honda Civic, a third-party liability policy would be approximately $800 per year. With Reliance General Insurance, its user-friendly claim process and focus on customer convenience work together to provide a smooth and reassuring experience during challenging times.\n",
      "User: Is there anything else I should consider?\n",
      "Agent: Given your age and occasional driving, personal accident cover is worth considering. This rider provides additional financial support in case of serious injury or death resulting from a road accident, covering medical expenses, disability, or loss of income for the insured driver and eligible passengers.\n",
      "User: How much would that add to the premium?\n",
      "Agent: Adding personal accident cover would increase the premium by about $50 per year. Since youâ€™re budget-conscious and prefer simplicity, this policy offers essential protection at an affordable price point.\n",
      "User: Okay, that doesn't sound too bad. What about discounts?\n",
      "Agent: Since you're renewing with us, you qualify for a loyalty discount. This discount rewards long-term customers with reduced premiums upon policy renewal, recognizing their loyalty and consistent risk profile over time.\n",
      "User: Alright, that sounds good. Let's go with the third-party liability and the personal accident cover.\n",

      "User: That sounds reasonable. Does it include zero depreciation?\n",
      "Agent: We can add a zero depreciation cover for an additional $100 per year. This ensures that in the event of a claim, the repair or replacement costs are calculated based on the current market value of new parts, rather than depreciated values, offering maximum reimbursement.\n",
      "User: Okay, that's good to know. I'm interested. Can you send me a quote with and without the zero depreciation cover?\n",
      "Agent: Absolutely! I'll email you both quotes right away. Many of our clients opt for the zero depreciation cover, as it can save you a lot of money in the long run.\n",
