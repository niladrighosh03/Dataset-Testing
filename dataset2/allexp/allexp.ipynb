      "User: I need to insure my 2024 Tesla Model 3. What are my options?\n",
      "Agent: The Tesla Model 3 is an excellent vehicle. As a business owner, you likely appreciate efficiency and reliability. HDFC ERGO General Insurance focuses on delivering prompt assistance and support around the clock, ensuring that any claims or inquiries are handled efficiently at any time.\n",
      "User: What kind of coverage do you recommend?\n",
      "Agent: Given that it’s a new and valuable car, I strongly recommend a comprehensive policy that includes Zero Depreciation cover and Insured Declared Value (IDV).\n",
      "User: Why is IDV important?\n",
      "Agent: IDV ensures you receive the original invoice value in the event of a total loss. In the case of a total loss, this cover guarantees that the payout will match the original purchase price of the vehicle as per the invoice, rather than the depreciated current value, providing greater financial relief.\n",
      "User: And what about coverage for the battery? It’s an electric car.\n",
      "Agent: Our comprehensive policy covers the battery against damage from accidents, fire, and certain types of malfunctions. Think of it as an investment in your safety and security. Accidents happen, and the cost of repairs can be significant.\n",
      "User: How much will all this cost?\n",
      "Agent: For a 2024 Tesla Model 3 with comprehensive coverage, Zero Depreciation, and IDV, the annual premium would be around $4200. Because you are a business owner and prioritize complete peace of mind, we can customize this policy to best suit you.\n",
      "User: That's a bit expensive. Are there any discounts available?\n",
      "Agent: Yes, we offer a digital purchase discount if you buy the policy online. Also, since you may not be driving as much, we can look at usage-based insurance to bring down the premium a bit, which rewards you for safe driving habits.\n",
      "User: Okay, that sounds interesting. Tell me more about the usage-based insurance.\n"
