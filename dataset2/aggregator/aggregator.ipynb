      "User: I need to renew my car insurance. It's for a 2010 Honda Civic.\n",
      "Selected Experts: ['intent expert', 'keyterm expert']\n",
      "Agent: Okay, a 2010 Honda Civic. Are you primarily concerned with the lowest possible price, or are there specific coverages you're interested in?\n",
      "Selected Experts: ['keyterm expert', 'sentiment expert']\n",
      "User: I'm on a fixed income, so price is definitely a factor. But I still need decent coverage.\n",
      "Selected Experts: ['sentiment expert', 'persuasion expert', 'keyterm expert']\n",
      "Agent: I understand. It’s important to protect yourself without breaking the bank. A third-party liability policy is the most affordable option, covering damages you might cause to others.\n",
      "Selected Experts: ['keyterm expert', 'intent expert']\n",
      "User: What does that actually cover?\n",
      "Selected Experts: ['keyterm expert', 'intent expert']\n",
      "Agent: It covers damages to another person's vehicle or property if you're at fault in an accident. It doesn't cover damages to your own car.\n",
      "Selected Experts: ['keyterm expert', 'intent expert']\n",
      "User: Hmm, I see. How much would that cost?\n",
      "Selected Experts: ['keyterm expert', 'persuasion expert', 'sentiment expert']\n",
      "Agent: For a 2010 Honda Civic, a third-party liability policy would be approximately $800 per year. With Reliance General Insurance, its user-friendly claim process and focus on customer convenience work together to provide a smooth and reassuring experience during challenging times.\n",

      "User: Is there anything else I should consider?\n",
      "Selected Experts: ['intent expert', 'keyterm expert']\n",
      "Agent: Given your age and occasional driving, personal accident cover is worth considering.

      "Selected Experts: ['keyterm expert', 'intent expert']\n",
      "User: How much would that add to the premium?\n",
      "Selected Experts: ['keyterm expert', 'persuasion expert']\n",
      "Agent: Adding personal accident cover would increase the premium by about $50 per year. Since you’re budget-conscious and prefer simplicity, this policy offers essential protection at an affordable price point.\n",
      "Selected Experts: ['intent expert', 'sentiment expert']\n",
      "User: Okay, that doesn't sound too bad. What about discounts?\n",
